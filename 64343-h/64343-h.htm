<p class='c003'>But don’t let it bother you. Any embarrassment
will be on our side. And we’re willing to
take the chance.</p>

<p class='c004'>All you stand to lose is three cents and a half
hour. To gain, a more interesting and helpful
SCOUTING.</p>

<p class='c004'>What I mean is, you’re No. 1 man on our
Board of Experts and your opinion is very
important to us.</p>

<p class='c004'>We know that you have one, that you make
up your mind very quickly as you thumb an
issue as to whether a page seems to interest
you, whether you’ll read it or keep thumbing.
Finally, whether it was worth your time, likely
to help you in <i>your</i> Scouting work.</p>

<p class='c004'>We can’t talk with you personally about your
ideas, and a long questionnaire would probably
send you scooting, so here’s a plan to do it the
easy way. It may look sketchy to you, but it
will really help us a lot.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here’s how it works—when you have finished
reading this issue—that is, all of it you
feel the urge to read—turn back to this page
and use the contents column as your survey
blank. Put checks opposite each article in the
columns that best describe your reaction. Then
write any comment you wish to add in that
small space at the bottom, note your Scouting
position, cut off the Contents strip on the dotted
line, slip it into an envelope and mail to us.</p>

<p class='c004'>I hope we will hear from you. It’ll be a real
Good Turn to all your fellow Scouters.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='c007'>★</span> <b>Buckshot to Memorial</b></p>
<p class='c004'>When John M. Phillips began his crusade for
conservation less than two generations ago, he was
taunted, reviled, threatened, and “accidentally”
shot in the legs three times. Sportsmen of that day
felt game was public property, and they dealt
roughly with “busybody conservationists.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But on an August Sunday in 1948, a new crop of
sportsmen met near Glenhazel, Pennsylvania, and
paid public tribute to the same John M. Phillips,
no longer taunted nor “accidentally” shot. Commonwealth
sportsmen now revere him as “Pennsylvania’s
grand old man of conservation.” On the
site of the first game lands purchased by the state,
they unveiled a huge boulder, bearing a keystone-shaped
plaque commemorating the work of Mr.
Phillips in developing a state-wide conservation
system.</p>

<p class='c004'>A member of the Advisory
Council of the Boy Scouts of
America, Mr. Phillips is 87
years old, and one of the few
men to have a memorial
erected in his honor while
still living.</p>

<p class='c004'>If you, too, have always taken it for granted that
delinquency is a crop native only to the teeming
metropolis, Albert S. Goss, Master of the National
Grange, has a shock for you.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The farmer,” reports Mr. Goss, “is now disturbed
about the rapid increase in delinquency.
He has finally come to the conclusion that the
greatest influence (in combatting delinquency) is
that of character-building organizations, the results
of which he is delighted with.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Among character-building organizations, “Scouting
for the country kid,” adds Mr. Goss, “is a
natural, for he has many things right at his back
door that Scouting offers (and) every one of the
Granges can sponsor a Scout Unit. There are 7,100
sub-units in the United States, and a special effort
is being made this year to push this. The sub-units
themselves own about 4,000 buildings.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Goss was speaking at a meeting of the National
Committee on Rural Scouting late last October.
The meeting was presided over by Mr. Wheeler
McMillen, Committee Chairman. Mr. McMillen,

Oregon, went down under fifteen feet of

Scout Troops and two Cub Packs barely
got ashore with the clothes on their backs, so
the boys from Schenectady began packing. To
Vanport went haversacks, uniforms, pins, badges,
and a welter of miscellany. But still the packages
didn’t look impressive enough to Troop 23, so into

<p class='c004'><span class='c007'>★</span> Scouting, like Christmas, is a thing of the
spirit. Everybody knows about the spirit of
Christmas! It is a spirit which makes itself felt in
the heart of man no matter where he may be.
There was the story of the landing at Casablanca
which tells of this spirit so vividly. The story, contained
in a letter to home by a Scout of yesterday,
relates:</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was Christmas Eve when we landed at Casablanca.
We were among the first contingent to
land, so we didn’t know what kind of reception
we’d get. Our officers gathered us together and
cautioned us about that. No one could predict if it
would be a friendly welcome or a welcome of
machine gun fire. So, as we marched up the main
street of Casablanca, we walked as silently as possible.
No one spoke to his neighbor. Everything
was expectant and utterly tense.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The march led toward the East, and as we
marched, my eye quickly picked out a bright star
shining down near the Eastern horizon. At once I
remembered another Star that likewise shone so
brightly on Christmas Eve. But now things seemed
so different. Danger and death apparently were
lurking behind every house as we passed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And then it happened—but not as we expected
it. For, coming clearly and crisply from a group
of buildings we were passing was the sound, not of
machine guns or rifles, but the sweet and lovely
strains of a blessed Christmas carol.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The effect was electric. We all felt it. I looked
at my buddy, who was a hard boiled sergeant. He
caught his lip in his teeth and with tears coursing
down his cheeks, he marched on unashamed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Well, there you have it. With the spirit of good
will moving in the hearts of men, the Christmas
spirit overcomes the rattle of the machine gun. It
is wonderful to contemplate what effect the Christmas
spirit has even on souls hardened by men at
war.</p>

<p class='c004'>More familiar, of course, are the homey evidences
of the Christmas spirit ... the smell of balsam
boughs and turkey roasting; the sight of the bright
red berries on a wreath of holly; the soft caress of
a falling snowflake on a moonlit Christmas Eve;
the unforgettable taste of that red and white
peppermint candy cane; and above all, the sweet
notes of Christmas carols falling on the ear—all
these things bring to us the spirit of Christmas at
home.</p>

<p class='c004'>But something deeper than all of that is there,
because Christmas reminds us of the song of the
angels, of “Peace on Earth among Men of Good
Will.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So similar is the spirit of Scouting, which grows
out of such vivid experiences as these: The smell
of woodfire with bacon broiling above it; the call
of the loon over the lake on a quiet night; the sight
of a great bird soaring over pines on a mountain
top; the comforting feel of your buddy’s shoulder
as you hike along a woodland trail at night; the
unforgettable taste of wild strawberries gathered
to augment the Patrol’s menu.</p>

<p class='c004'>These things have a part, it is true, in the spirit
of Scouting, but there is something far deeper, as
we all know. For Scouting, like Christmas, is a
thing of the spirit.</p>
<h3 class='c018'>“Happyfying”</h3>

<p class='c017'>No season is happier than the Christmas season,
and the secret of that happiness lies in what our
founder, Baden-Powell, called
“happyfying.” It is the philosophy
of the old song, “I want to be
happy, but I can’t be happy, ’till
I make you happy, too.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Our Christmas turkey loses its
taste and becomes dry fodder unless
we have done something to
make somebody else happy at
Christmas time.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now that is the spirit of Scouting
at Christmas and at all other seasons.
It was put into the Scout spirit
by Baden-Powell. The implication
is clear. Our happiness all year
through, as Scouts, grows out of
the many acts we do to bring happiness
to those around us.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is a fine thing for the Troop to
engage in national or community
programs of service. We should do
that as good citizens. It is an even
greater thing for a Patrol to single
out some very human service they
can perform for somebody close at
hand. And when these Scouts see
the smile on the face of the neighbor
they have helped, then they
know all about “happyfying” and
their own lives are blest, too.</p>

<p class='c004'>And the Scoutmaster, or other
Unit Leader, knows about “happyfying,”
for is he not making a
Christmas gift to the nation every
week in the year as he carries on
his Scoutmastership? Thus he,
himself, receives dividends the like
of which no billionaire in history
ever knew. So it was that one such
Scoutmaster speaking at the last
meeting of our National Council
was able to say, “When the Scoutmaster
looks around him and
counts his blessings, he finds that
his reward is the richest of all.”</p>
<p class='c016'><b>Good Will</b></p>
<p class='c004'>The youngest Cub Scout, of
course, knows about good will, for
does not the Law of the Pack remind
him that “A Cub gives good
will?” So, in the Boy Scout experience
he finds that “The Scout is a
friend to all and a brother to every
other Scout.” As he grows older he
learns more of the World Brotherhood
of Scouting and finds that
good will among men knows no
boundaries of race or creed, or
nationality.</p>

<p class='c004'>The beloved song of the angels at
Christmastime, then, is the thing
that Scouting is trying to do all
year round. Insofar as Scouting
builds its brotherhood and gives
good will all year round, will it be
speeding that day of “Peace on
Earth.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='c007'>★</span> We have it on good authority that 53% of
the boys of America live “way out there,”
in the little crossroads settlements and on the
miles-apart farms.</p>

<p class='c004'>We all know that we have a big opportunity
and responsibility to reach out into that open
country. We also know that it is a hard job.</p>

<p class='c004'>To help bring this rural business into the
spotlight, SCOUTING Magazine asked eight
men to join in one of our Round Table discussions.
These men represent all phases of rural
life and of Scouting. The “moderator’s gavel”
will be wielded by the Chairman of our National
Committee on Rural Scouting, Wheeler McMillen,
who as the Editor-in-chief of the <i>Farm
Journal</i> and the <i>Pathfinder Magazine</i>, has a host
of friends throughout America.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. McMillen, will you take over?</p>
<hr class='c019' />
<p class='c020'><b>McMILLEN: I feel honored to join you fine
men, who represent so many aspects of modern
farm life. We all have one thing in common—we
want that boy who lives on the farm to have
a good break. Some of us believe that the Scouting
program can play a big part in his growth.</b></p>
<p class='c004'><b>We should face this whole question objectively
and constructively. Let’s start by asking a
rather blunt question: <i>Do rural boys really
need Scouting? Or is their normal life already
filled with the ingredients which make for character
and good citizenship?</i></b></p>
<p class='c016'><b>VERNON NICHOLS, SCOUTMASTER</b>: They
need it very much. Scouting not only builds character,
but it helps especially in developing leadership,
a quality often lacking in farm boys.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>HOWARD F. FOX, SUPERVISOR, VOCATIONAL
AGRICULTURE</b>: The boys who live in
small towns need Scouting, but I think those who
live on farms need it in less degree.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>JOE C. CARRINGTON, COUNCIL PRESIDENT</b>:
I can’t agree with Mr. Fox. Farm boys need it even
more than town boys, who have more supervised
playgrounds, more church and school and club-sponsored
programs. The rural boy has very little
to round out his life, and really needs Scouting.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>L. H. ELEAZER, CUBMASTER</b>: Perhaps the elements
are there on the farm, but Scouting can help
bring them out. Sometimes when a man is close to
a thing, he doesn’t see it in its real light. Also, all
rural boys do not stay on the farms where they
were reared. These boys need much of the same
kind of training their city brothers get.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>CARRINGTON</b>: That raises a good point—when
the rural boy moves to town, he very often has no
entering wedge into the youth programs there. But
if he is a Scout in the rural area he can transfer
his membership and make a transition which
would have been difficult without Scouting. Its
universality is an important feature.</p>

</div>
<p class='c016'><b>McMILLEN: I see you’re all nodding in agreement,
including Mr. Fox. Actually we have never
really questioned the need, have we? It’s the
ways to use Scouting best and to get it to the
rural boy, that bothers us.</b></p>
<p class='c016'><b>FOREST WITCRAFT, SCOUT EXECUTIVE</b>:
Does it really need to bother us? Of course it’s
hard to take Scouting out to the boys in the open
country, but plenty of Councils have proved that
it can be done.</p>
<p class='c004'>I’m thinking of Draper in my South Dakota
country, with a population of 190, Barnard with 60,
Strandburg with 177, Stratford, Northville and
Garden City adding 700 more—six communities
with a little better than 1100, supporting <i>ten thriving
Scout Units</i>. I think of places like Tulare (population
244) with 19 Scouts, 17 of whom come
from their farms. It can be done.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>FOX</b>: The crux of the problem is probably leadership.
Can rural communities supply it? There is no
question in my mind but that it’s there, but will
men who do hard physical work long hours every
day in the week give the time needed for Scouting?</p>
<p class='c016'><b>HENRY P. CARSTENSEN, MASTER, STATE
GRANGE</b>: Part of the problem here is the tendency
of parents of rural youth to take the attitude
that Scouting is a non-essential activity, a luxury
which they cannot afford.</p>
<p class='c004'>Some good parent education would make it
easier to get leaders and thus to spread Scouting.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>CARRINGTON</b>: There are ways to get men in
the farm country. As District Chairman, I used
a well-known method that worked wonderfully.
I used a survey blank that asked boys the question
“Who do you think is the best man in your community,
and why?” The kids would name men
whom we hadn’t thought of, and give good reasons.
When we went to such men and told them
why the boys thought they were tops, resistance
faded away and we usually had our leaders.</p>
<p class='c004'>In most communities the leadership is there if
we know how to dig for it.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>NICHOLS</b>:  Leadership may be there all right, but
believe me, <i>trained</i> leadership is sure lacking. That
is where our Local Councils need to give us more
help—short courses that busy men can attend. I
think time and money spent by the Local Council
assisting new leaders would be well spent.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>
<img src='images/i07.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c021'><b>WITCRAFT</b>: Training becomes harder as the distance
between your Scout Units increases. Here are
a few ways we have been able to get training to
our men:</p>
<p class='c004'>(a) We run week-end training courses.</p>

<p class='c004'>(b) Our monthly Round Tables are packed with
training as well as fellowship.</p>

<p class='c004'>(c) The One-Unit course is tops—the committee
joins with the leaders in an at-home training experience.
This may lack some of the advantages of
larger courses but it has some of its own.</p>

<p class='c004'>(d) We count heavily on personal coaching by
our Field Executives and Commissioner Staff.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>McMILLEN: Before we get too deeply into
Council methods of handling country Scouting,
let’s study it a bit more from the boy’s angle.
What aspects of Scouting are most interesting
and helpful to boys?</b></p>
<p class='c016'><b>ELEAZER</b>: I would say the most interesting aspect
to the rural boy is camping. The most helpful
is probably the achievement part of the program.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>FOX</b>: I put this question to the forty students in
my vocational agriculture class, well over half of
whom are or have been Scouts. The younger boys
put camping first; the older ones put it on a level
with advancement skills. All of them rated these
two aspects of Scouting tops.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>NICHOLS</b>: One of the values I see my boys get
out of camping is the ability to work with others.
Too often rural boys do not have a chance to develop
this important trait. That’s why group activity
is especially important to rural boys too.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>McMILLEN: A very good point, Mr. Nichols.
Our rural boys aren’t different, but sometimes
their opportunity to develop certain abilities
and traits is limited: Scouting’s camping and its
group activity can fill a big void.</b></p>
<p class='c016'><b>Speaking about program, what do you think
of the Merit Badge work?</b></p>
<p class='c016'><b>FOX</b>: In the first place, rural boys like to receive
recognition for things they do, as well as any
youth. I know that many of the Merit Badges encourage
farm boys to improve their agricultural
skills. Experienced farmers make good counselors
in agricultural subjects.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>NICHOLS</b>: The rural boy possibly needs the
Merit Badge program more than does the city boy
because he has less access to these “idea sources.”
He needs to know about trades and occupations,
too, other than those found on the farm.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>WITCRAFT</b>: In addition to the values the Merit
Badge program holds for the boy, it has two other
big values; it has sold many rural people on Scouting
because farmers readily see the value of such
subjects as Beef Production and Soil Management.
It has also brought many men into Scouting. A man
gets a taste of Scouting while serving as a Merit
Badge Counselor and, liking this experience, accepts
other leadership responsibilities.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>McMILLEN: Mr. Witcraft’s comment about
adults reminds me of a frequent criticism heard
in the rural field that such activities as Scouting
interfere with a boy’s responsibilities to his farm
home. Is this so, and need it be so?</b></p>
<p class='c016'><b>L. O. PARKER, COUNTY FARM AGENT</b>: It is
true that they could interfere, but I don’t think it
happens often. When the Unit Leader and Committee
are rural people they will recognize this problem
and avoid it.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>ELEAZER</b>: Getting to and from meetings sometimes
poses a problem. Perhaps a less frequent
Troop meeting would be the answer, with Patrol
meetings in the boys’ homes in between.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>NICHOLS</b>: The camp may be the biggest problem,
if it comes in the middle of the harvest season.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>FOX</b>: Camp doesn’t really have to interfere, does
it? Each Troop would naturally schedule its camp
dates to miss the busiest season in that area.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>NICHOLS</b>: I didn’t mean that the camping problem
was hard to overcome. Certainly it is so important
to a farm boy that we must get it in somehow.
Going to the Council camp helps us realize that we
belong to something bigger than our own Troop in
our own little community. In the same way, inter-Troop
activities help us keep on our toes.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>PARKER</b>: I certainly agree that camping is important,
but it is the Scouting activity which is
most likely to conflict with home responsibilities.
Councils with rural territory should be very aware
of the problem, and should handle it realistically.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>CARSTENSEN</b>: This whole discussion of competitive
activity raises another question which we in
the Grange feel is important. That is, that leaders
of all youth movements should recognize the need
for closer contact and understanding—the need
for planning together so that their problems will
be coordinated rather than conflicting.</p>

<p class='c020'>We have tried to work this way in developing
our Juvenile Grange program; we have made an
effort to support such activities as the Boy Scouts,
the 4H, Future Farmers, etc.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>FOX</b>: I am not too much concerned about the danger
of competition. Neither the 4H nor the F.F.A.
cover the entire country, by any means. Furthermore,
my experience has been that boys can belong
to both F.F.A. and the Scouts and do a good job of
both. Then, too, since Future Farmers are all older
boys, their activities become a continuation of the
leadership training received in Scouting.</p>

<p class='c021'><b>PARKER</b>: We in 4H like to have our boys active
in Scouting. Scouting and 4H strengthen one another.
For example, Scouting recognizes with its
Merit Badge awards the work our boys do in 4H
projects. Scouting provides programs in non-agricultural
subjects which 4H does not offer.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>WITCRAFT</b>: Let’s go even stronger than that.
There isn’t nearly as much competition for a boy’s
time in the country as there is in the city; that’s
one of the reasons Scouting is so much needed in
the country.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>McMILLEN: All of this brings us face to face
with the pay-off question: Granted that Scouting
has a program needed by country boys, and that
there are ways of making it work, what help is
most needed by isolated rural Units, and how
can the Local Council best provide this help?</b></p>
<p class='c016'><b>ELEAZER</b>: The help most needed by those of us
who lead rural Packs and Troops is that which can
be given by the Executive or a Field Executive.
This is especially true when we start new Units.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>NICHOLS</b>: Training is our No. 1 need, and this
includes our Committees. Our Council made a good
move in filling its monthly District meetings with
real training and a lot of good fellowship.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>WITCRAFT</b>: That word “fellowship” is especially
important. When men live a long ways apart they
need opportunities to get together. The Council
must find ways to make this happen.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>FOX</b>: Financing rural work also seems to be a
problem. I am not too familiar with Scouting, but
I wonder if this does need to be a problem?</p>
<p class='c016'><b>NICHOLS</b>: This is probably more true in times of
financial stress than it is now, but there is a problem
to face. One thing is sure, the stronger and
more active the Troop, the easier it is to raise
funds. If the people of a community see that Scouting
is doing a lot for the boys, they’ll support it.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>CARRINGTON</b>: In our Council we furnish Scouting
service all over our area, but we think it’s right to
apportion more Field Executive time to the Districts
which are providing adequate funds to make that
field service possible.</p>
<p class='c004'>At the same time, we carry on an organized extension
program in all areas with the hope that all
will make use of Scouting and give it their support.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>WITCRAFT</b>: It is true that the cost of rural Scouting
has often delayed Councils in coming to grips
with the rural problem. Usually we have assumed
that Scouting starts in the city, moves out to the
small towns and eventually filters down to the
village and open country.</p>
<p class='c004'>The Council faces a practical problem. It has a
certain amount of time and money. How can these
be spent most wisely? The same amount of work
that will organize a rural Troop of six boys at Olson’s
Corners will organize a Troop of twenty boys
in the headquarters city. It has seemed to be sound
business to spend Council money where it would
bring Scouting to the most boys.</p>

<p class='c004'>But consider what this means to Olaf Torkelson,
twelve years old, out at Olson’s Corners. Can we
say to him, “Sorry, Olaf, but it will probably be
several years before we can organize marginal
places like Olson’s Corners.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Our Council, at its coming Annual Meeting, will
take action on a proposal by our Organization and
Extension Committee that we shall henceforth recognize
an equal responsibility to all boys within
our area, regardless of where they live.</p>

<p class='c004'>We believe such an approach would be financially
sound, and that the rural area will support it.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>FOX</b>: I broached this question of cost, but actually
I don’t think it’s serious. The open country has the
boys, and wants them to have their chance. The
money can be secured if we approach the right
people. For example, some farm cooperatives now
have educational programs. They might see big
dividends in efforts spent to help Scouting develop
leaders among rural youth.</p>
<p class='c004'>Farming has become so complex that the country
can no longer afford to let its best youth go to the
city. Today farming demands the best brains as
well as the strongest bodies the nation can produce.
The modern farmer must organize, manage,
finance, produce, and market.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scouting can, and does help round out a rural
boy’s life. It builds the kind of men the nation
needs on its farms.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>McMILLEN: This has been good talk. It has
been all the more persuasive because we have
heard the voices of men who have actually
“reached out.” Rural Scouting is a fact that
grows all the time.</b></p>
<p class='c016'><b>One thought in closing: No one has much
trouble to get boys into Scouting. But in order
to keep the Scout groups flourishing, we need
more men who will give leadership. I would like
to suggest that no Council’s annual dinner, or
outdoor event, will be quite complete unless the
top leaders in farm and rural business activities
are personally invited to see and hear for themselves.
Pay them more attention and they will
pay more attention to Scouting.</b></p>

  <h2 class='c002'>SCOUTING ON MAIN STREET</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c001'>
    <div><i>By Edward Belason</i>,</div>
    <div class='c006'><span class='small'>Assistant Director of Public Relations</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='c007'>★</span> BOY SCOUT WEEK will soon be upon us.
For one entire week in February you will
hear and see a lot about Scouting as the general
public finds itself becoming Scouting-conscious.</p>

<p class='c004'>You will hear <i>Scouting</i> on the radio, see <i>Scouting</i>
in newspapers and magazines, and rub elbows
with <i>Scouting</i> as Scouts go to and from school in
their uniforms.</p>

<p class='c004'>As a Scout leader, you will want to make the
best use of the nationwide publicity and direct the
attention of people in YOUR community to the
activities of THEIR Scouts. One ideal method for
a local Unit is through a Scout display in a store
window with a prominent location.</p>

<p class='c004'>The three immediate advantages of a window
display are: ONE, the general public becomes
Scouting-conscious; TWO, the Unit has a live and
unusual program for several days; and THREE,
boys who are not now Scouts see an opening for
themselves to join the Unit.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>Plan Your Display</b></p>
<p class='c004'>Before you ask a merchant for window space,
have some plans for your display on paper, or at
least in your mind. Explain to him the advantages
to the community, to Scouting, and to his store.
Most storekeepers are willing to cooperate. Larger
shops may even offer the services of trained window
decorators. Once you obtain the space you
have a responsibility to both the merchant and to
Scouting to install the neatest and most interesting
display you and your staff can create. No doubt
you can get some valuable help from your Local
Council.</p>

<p class='c004'>Build your display around the theme for 1949—“Adventure—That’s
Scouting!” Show the folks in
your community that your Unit spells Adventure
with a capital “A.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Make a list of the items you will want to display,
such as photographs, handicraft articles,
posters, flags, collections, knot boards, books, etc.
Select those which you can make outstanding.
Don’t crowd the window; use just what you have
room for.</p>

<p class='c004'>After the list is decided upon, get the Unit’s
specialists on the job. Get the shutter bugs busy
on photographs, the craftsmen to their work
benches, and the artists to their layout pads. Photos
are one of the best mediums for telling your story.
Select those that truly represent Scouting activities.
Enlarge them and mount them neatly, with
captions easily read.</p>

<p class='c004'>The background, too, should be eye-catching. It
should be large enough that passersby will be
arrested and enticed to step up close to look over
the display. You can make a good backdrop with
a photo illustrating Scout adventure, and enlarged
to take in practically the entire background. If
you cannot get extra size enlargements in your
community, choose several photos, make 11″ × 14″
enlargements and group them to form an artistic
background. Or you might have your boys make a
large Scout emblem from beaverboard and color it.
Another possibility is to mount several photos on
wallboard cut to the shape of the Scout badge.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id009'>
<img src='images/i09.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>Experiment with arrangements in advance, so
that when you enter the store you can trim the
window in the quickest possible time.</p>

<p class='c004'>Chalk off the actual window area on the meeting
room floor. Place smaller items in the foreground,
and gradually build up to the background. If
pedestals are needed, perhaps the storekeeper may
lend them to you. If he has none, make some of
cardboard and gummed tape. Cigar boxes, paper
cartons, and tin cans, painted or covered with
colored paper, can be used.</p>

<p class='c004'>Extremely bright colors will sometimes detract
from the items on display. Avoid them or use them
carefully. Neutral colors can easily be arranged
to compliment and flatter the displayed items. For
example, when exhibiting a collection of leather-craft
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>items, a cream or light green will show them
up better than bright red or blue.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i10.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>Arrange the articles to create continuity. It isn’t
necessary that each item be seen from every angle.
Avoid over-crowding; it has a tendency to confuse
and tire the window-shopper. He may walk away
and perhaps miss the essence of your message.</p>

<p class='c004'>Not until you have had your “dress rehearsal”
are you ready to install your display in the store
window. The pet peeve of any shopkeeper is to
have his store upset while windows are being
dressed, especially if the job takes too long. Agree
on the time convenient to him, then do the job
rapidly and neatly. Don’t send the whole gang over.
Pick two or three good workers and let them
handle it. A good job done efficiently will undoubtedly
get you a return invitation next year.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE DUST OF THE ROUND-UP SETTLES</h2>
</div>
<div  class='figright id010'>
<img src='images/i11.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c016'><span class='c007'>★</span> The Round-Up that started along the Old
Scouting Trail three months ago is heading
for the biggest event of all—the final “branding,”
when the “mavericks,” the new boys brought into
Scouting this fall, are formally and officially
brought into the corral.</p>
<p class='c004'>The “branding” ceremony, which should be staged
in early December, can be one of the most colorful
events your Unit ever held. Put it on with all the
spirit and zip of a real western event. Use imagination
in the staging—a few corral fence rails
in the background, a fire “burning” in front, and
the investiture team in cowboy togs. Think in
western terms when you write the investiture
script. Act out the Round-Up and branding with a
nice combination of cowboy color and dignity, and
your new boys and your public will remember the
night of the “branding” ceremony for a long, long
time.</p>

<p class='c004'>When that final ceremony is staged, the “branding”
done, we will have time to lean back against
the old corral fence and take stock of the results.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>What do we see as the dust of our Round-Up
settles?</i> How well did we round up the strays? Are
there still boys “out there” who should be getting
Scouting, and who could be, if we were really on
our toes?</p>

<p class='c004'>Before <i>you</i> hang up <i>your</i> spurs and lariat, won’t
you check up once more on that boy that showed
up at two or three meetings and looked as though
he wanted to join but somehow didn’t make it.</p>

<p class='c004'>You might be surprised at what you would find
if you called on his folks—so often boys are kept
out of Scouting because of misunderstandings
which can be so easily cleared up when you talk
to the parents. Lots of boys get that close to Scouting
before they are shut out. The extra time given
to this personal follow-up will be some of the
best you ever spent on Scouting.</p>

<p class='c004'>This may seem like a lot about membership,
but remember, all of us who really believe in
Scouting’s value to a boy, want to do our part to
extend Scouting opportunity to as many boys as
we can handle in our Unit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Membership facts, by the way, are a good measuring
rod of our program. When there’s fun and
adventure in a Scout Unit most every boy wants
to join. When there’s always something new and
interesting happening, they want to stay in.</p>

<p class='c004'>That’s what our membership figures really represent—our
ability to provide the <i>opportunity to
join</i>, plus the <i>program that holds</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Much of this fall’s Round-Up activity has been
designed to provide more of the <i>opportunity to
join</i>, as well as a good deal of planning for <i>the
program that holds boys</i>. Now we need to follow
through on that program. That means <i>steady attention
to the regular activities</i>, whatever they may
be—the Den meetings, the Patrol meetings and
weekly Troop or Senior Unit meetings, and <i>special
attention to the highlights</i> that serve to “point up”
the boy’s Scouting experience.</p>

<p class='c004'>What are some of these highlights? In Cub
Scouting the monthly Pack meetings are highlight
events; each one is different and apparently
more interesting than those that have gone before.</p>

<p class='c004'>Up and coming Boy Scout Troops and Senior
Units plan their highlights in a different way. They
schedule at intervals through the year a number
of events specially chosen to give a lift and a purpose
to the week-by-week program. They use these
special events as something to look forward to,
something to prepare for, and afterward, of course,
to look back on with happy memories.</p>

<p class='c004'>Well, it’s time to boost ourselves off that old
corral post and get going. There’s things to do
around this ranch and now’s the time to be doing
them!</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>DON’T FORGET THE DENNER</h2>
</div>
<div  class='figcenter id007'>

<div  class='figright id011'>
<img src='images/i12c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c003'><span class='c007'>◆</span> The Denner is probably the most neglected
and forgotten leader in Cub Scouting. Yet he
is one of the most important links between other
Cub Scout leaders and the Cub Scouts themselves.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Denner is elected by the boys. While their
standards may be different from the standards of
adults, you can probably trust them to select the
boy whose leadership they are most ready to accept.</p>

<p class='c004'>If there is any influencing of the election, probably
the best point to bring out is that the older
boy with more experience is usually the best.</p>

<p class='c004'>Usually the term of office is not long. However,
there is no specific limit. If the term is not too
long, more boys will have an opportunity to practice
leadership. On the other hand, if it is too short,
no Denner serves long enough to become a really
helpful leader.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>HIS RESPONSIBILITIES</b></p>
<p class='c004'>The Denner is the right-hand man of the Den
Chief. Here are a few of the responsibilities which
the Denner in most Dens can and should assume:</p>

<p class='c004'>1. Arrive early to prepare meeting place.</p>

<p class='c004'>2. Meet with Den Chief and Den Mother to go
over last minute plans for the meeting.</p>

<p class='c004'>3. There are times when he can lead games or
songs. This will require coaching from the Den
Chief, and also some backing during the activity.</p>

<p class='c004'>4. He often keeps and reads the Den diary although
in some Dens another member of the Den
carries on this responsibility.</p>

<p class='c004'>5. He can also help with simpler ceremonies. For
example, he should lead the Grand Howl and Living
Circle. When the Den repeats the Den Promise
and the Law of the Pack, he is the logical leader.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>HIS BADGE OF OFFICE</b></p>
<p class='c004'>The Denner wears his Denner’s Stripe six inches
below his left shoulder seam. An Assistant Denner
wears a single stripe in the same position.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Denner relinquishes the badge of office
when he no longer holds that office. Only one boy
in the Den wears the Denner’s stripes at any one
time. Explain to the Den that Denner’s Stripes are
not an award for service but a badge to designate
the boy who holds the office. It should be presented
to the boy at a ceremony either at a Den Meeting
or a regular Pack Meeting.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>SOME GENERAL TIPS</b></p>
<p class='c004'>1. If the office is to seem important and worthwhile,
the Denner must have an active part in the
leadership of Den activities.</p>

<p class='c004'>2. Sometimes a boy becomes a little overbearing.
You may have to tone him down a bit, and make
clear to him that one mark of a good leader is to
lead in such a way that folks like to follow.</p>

<p class='c004'>3. Make the election of a Denner an important
matter. Discuss it thoroughly. Make clear to the
boys that the boy they elect will definitely be their
leader once he is elected and they are then expected
to follow him.</p>

<p class='c004'>4. Recognize the Denner. A bit of recognition
will make his leadership more helpful.</p>

<p class='c004'>5. The Den Chief and the Den Mother should see
that the Denner has a happy experience. If the
boys do not follow his leadership, it will tend to
discourage him from further leadership efforts.</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c003'><span class='c007'>◆</span> Yes, we know it’s only December, but it’s not
too early to begin to think about the way
your Pack will celebrate Boy Scout Week in February
of 1949. This will be Scouting’s 39th birthday,
and it’s a time for celebration for everybody
related to the Boy Scouts of America.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some Cub Scout Leaders feel since our birthday
is called “Boy Scout Week,” that the celebration
includes only Boy Scouts. This simply isn’t true;
it’s the birthday of our Movement and those of us
in Cub Scouting are very much a part of the Scout
Movement. So—here are a few advance tips
which will help you look ahead to February and
make some plans. More detailed tips will appear
in January <span class='sc'>Scouting</span>.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>ADVENTURE—THAT’S CUB SCOUTING</b></p>
<p class='c004'>As you know, each Boy Scout Week has its
theme or big idea, and in 1949 it will be “Adventure—That’s
Scouting.” Of course, to you that
means “Adventure—That’s Cub Scouting,” so
you’ll be wanting to emphasize the adventure part
of our program.</p>

<p class='c004'>As usual, Blue and Gold will be our program
theme for February. This has become a tradition in
Cub Scouting. It’s an annual party occasion with
Boy Scout Week as its theme. Perhaps your Blue
and Gold party will be in the form of a potluck
where everyone brings his own food, or perhaps
you’ll do it banquet style. However you do it, it
will be the basis for a month of preparation on the
part of both Cub Scout Leaders and Cub Scouts.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>THE UNIFORM</b></p>
<p class='c004'>Encourage parents to look ahead to Boy Scout
Week and attempt to have their boys in complete
Cub Scout uniform by February. Cub Scouts will
want to wear their uniforms to school and to
church. They will want their uniforms in spick and
span condition.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>SCOUT SUNDAY</b></p>
<p class='c004'>Plan ahead so that your Pack will fit into some
scheme for attending church on the Sunday of Boy
Scout Week. If your Pack is sponsored by a church,
perhaps all boys who belong to that church will sit
in a body with their parents on that particular
Sunday. Perhaps you could even work out some
plan whereby Cub Scouts will participate in the
church service or prepare an exhibit for the entrance
hall of the church.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>YOUR SPONSORING INSTITUTION</b></p>
<p class='c004'>Perhaps your Pack is sponsored by a P.T.A. or
a civic club which has regular monthly meetings.
If so, why not start working on a plan where your
Pack might have some part in the February meeting
of the organization. It is not necessary for the
Cub Scouts themselves to attend the meeting, but
an exhibit or a display and perhaps several representatives
of the Pack would help to put the spotlight
on Boy Scout Week.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>WINDOW DISPLAYS</b></p>
<p class='c004'>Every Pack should try to prepare a Cub Scout
window display in a community store. If possible,
pick a store window which is located in the neighborhood
of your Pack. These are the folks who will
be most interested in what you are doing. You will
find some suggestions on Cub Scout window displays
in the January <span class='sc'>Scouting</span> Magazine.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>SPECIAL PUBLICITY</b></p>
<p class='c004'>Urge your Cub Scouts to listen to the radio during
Boy Scout Week. There will be statements
about Scouting in connection with all nationwide
programs. Try to fit into this general scheme in
your community and get some Pack news into your
community paper.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>AMERICAN CUB SCOUT DEN IN PERU</h2>
</div>
<div  class='figcenter id013'>
<img src='images/i14.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic013'>
<p><i>By Mrs. A. R. Merz</i><br />La Oroya, Peru</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c003'><span class='c007'>◆</span> “Gee, mother, all the Cubs are wearing their
new uniforms to school and there’s four—let
me see, how many Cubs are there now? I guess
five, Cub caps in a row in the cloakroom, and now
the two Scout caps, and, gee, they look nice!”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was Boy Scout Week and the five Cub Scouts
and two Boy Scouts, whose uniform accessories
had just arrived from BSA Headquarters in New
York were 100% thrilled at the privilege of wearing
their new gear every day to school. The boys
are members of Den One and Patrol One, the only
officially registered Scout groups in the Sierra of
Peru, and doubtless the highest in all the world—for
the altitude where we live is 12,500 feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>On January 7, 1947, the parents of the only four
boys then eligible to join any Scout group met and
decided that even with so few it would be worth
everyone’s effort to start a Cub Den. We were all
members of the small mining camp (about 50
“gringo” families) of the extensive Cerro de Pasco
Copper Corporation called La Oroya.</p>

<p class='c004'>Since then, four new boys of Cub Scout age have
come to camp and been admitted, and four of
the original five have attained their twelfth birthdays
and are now enjoying their first meetings as
a Boy Scout Neighborhood Patrol. Without exception,
the younger boys are all looking forward to
their ninth birthdays so that they may join the
envied group of Cub Scouts.</p>

<p class='c004'>Our first month was dedicated to getting acquainted
with Scouting literature, its history and
intent, and fixing up the gravel-floored garage
loaned to us as meeting place by the Cubmaster.
We borrowed the unused school workbench, decorated
walls with Cub Scout plaques, American
and Den Flags, and the framed Den Charter. With
the help of local men, often not themselves fathers
of Cub Scouts, we made many things of wood, tin,
and copper during the year. But the regular meetings
are held at the Den Mother’s home, or at the
homes of all the boys in rotation when the Den
Mother is out of town.</p>

<p class='c004'>Our theme for the second month was “Books,”
when we learned how to care for books and specialized
in the Reading Achievement. Now the company-sponsored
Inca Club has a children’s book-shelf
for the first time in its thirty years.</p>

<p class='c004'>During April and May we made musical instruments
and practiced using them—I can hardly say
playing them—for a minstrel act that was part
of a five-part program we gave at the end of the
school term in June.</p>

<p class='c004'>In July we had our first “Pack” meeting—the
same few boys, but with their parents and the
general manager and his wife as guests. Each boy
personally prepared one dish to be served, and
each mother another, so we had a generous banquet
that night in the Golf club.</p>

<p class='c004'>In December, with “Service” as our theme, we
collected odds and ends of broken or non-used toys
and outgrown clothing. By mid-month the garage
was overflowing, and with the mothers we managed
to get the hopeless looking pile reduced to
gifts in acceptable condition to distribute to the
poverty-stricken Indian children of Old Oroya.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, even as you, we are planning a minstrel
show.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>

</div>
<p class='c003'><span class='c007'>◆</span> This month there will be musical games, new
Cub Scout songs to sing, and a minstrel show
planned and put on. It’s going to be a big month,
and the following ideas will help make it so.</p>

<p class='c004'>Naturally, we can’t tell you which type of music
is most typical in your section. That is something
Pack and Den leaders will discover during December
in preparation for the January theme.
School music teachers can help, as well as most
libraries. Each Den can choose a song and do it in
costume for the minstrel show.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of course, the boys of the Southwest will be singing
cowboy songs such as “Home On the Range,”
“Headin’ For the Last Round-Up,” “Cowboy’s Lament,”
The boys of New England may choose
to sing sea-farin’ chanteys, such as “Blow the Man
Down,” or “Reuben Ranzo.” (A laughable stunt
would be to have a Cub Scout on stage going
through singing motions while a hidden “<i>basso
profundo</i>” sings “Rocked In the Cradle of the
Deep.”) Boys of the South will probably sing
southern ballads and spirituals.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>HOMEMADE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</b></p>
<p class='c004'>You will find this a most popular field with Cub
Scouts. They can actually make instruments that
will have musical tones as well as being comedy
take-offs of actual instruments. You will find a
page of ideas for homemade
musical instruments
on page <a href='#Page_17'>17</a> of this issue of <span class='sc'>Scouting</span>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Naturally, it’s a lot more
fun to make these instruments
if the boys know
they are going to use them
in your Pack meeting or
minstrel show.</p>

<p class='c004'>Perhaps each Den will
have its own “kitchen cabinet”
type of band. All
Dens can practice the same
songs, then come together
at the Pack meeting in one
big band and play them together.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another interesting field
is to make rhythm instruments
which boys play to
the tune of a phonograph
record. Rhythm instruments include pot cover cymbals,
rattles, blocks of wood, and tin cans.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>CUB SCOUT MUSICIANS</b></p>
<p class='c004'>Perhaps there is a boy in your Den who does
most things poorly but plays or sings well. This is
the month he can shine. Encourage boys with
musical instruments to practice their best numbers
and play or sing solos for the minstrel.</p>

<p class='c004'>You will probably find several boys in your Den,
and surely a number in your Pack, who will be interested
in writing Den or Pack words to old time
songs. Occasionally we even find a boy or two who
can compose simple music and words so that a
Den can have an entirely original song.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>GROUP AND FAMILY SINGS</b></p>
<p class='c004'>Why not suggest that each Den Mother invite
boys and parents of her Den into her home on a
Sunday afternoon. They could sing old time songs
together, and boys who play instruments can put
on an informal recital for parents. Perhaps there
will be a dad or mother who can sing a solo.</p>

<p class='c004'>In addition to Den sings, families will enjoy
singing together occasionally. None of these things
will happen—Den Mothers won’t think to ask the
parents over, and boys won’t be asked to play
their instruments—unless you push the idea.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>JANUARY PACK MEETING TIPS</b></p>
<p class='c004'>The Cubmaster or member of the Pack Committee
can give a short talk on the importance of parents
looking for opportunities to recognize their
sons for having done projects found in the Achievement
Program. Many times boys will complete
projects without realizing they are meeting a requirement
for an Achievement. For example, a
boy may make a boat just because he is going to a
lake and would like to have one to sail. Unless his
parents point out that he has met the requirements
for the Model Boats Elective, he may never
receive credit for it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Opportunity should be given for parents to ask
questions on the Achievement Program. The Cubmaster
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>should also cover current items, such as
condition of the Pack Thrift Plan, attendance, etc.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>JOINT MEETING</b>.</p>
<p class='c004'>You will find minstrel show tips on page 16,
but here are a few suggestions on how your meeting
may be adapted to the minstrel show idea:</p>

<p class='c004'>If there are badges to award, award them immediately
after the separate meeting, so you will
not cut into minstrel show time. Before the show
explain to the boys the program for the month
ahead, and interest them in the Blue and Gold
party.</p>

<p class='c004'>Skip a formal closing this month. Close your
Pack meeting with the grand finale of the minstrels.
Make all announcements before the show
begins. On page 16 you will find some ideas on preparing
and staging your minstrel show. Here we are
concerned mostly with the regular Pack meeting
outline.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>Pre-Opening.</b></p>
<p class='c004'>During the pre-opening, boys remain in uniforms
rather than wear minstrel costumes. Save the costumes
as a surprise. Each Den should have a table
available for exhibits developed during the month,
especially homemade instruments, music scrapbooks,
Cub Scout-composed music, etc.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>Separate Meetings.</b></p>
<p class='c004'>During this period Den leaders, with the help of
others if necessary, should help the boys get ready
for the minstrel show. It will not be difficult in the
time allowed, because in most minstrels only end
men wear blackface. Leaders should also make
sure the boys know their songs, jokes, and stories.
Just before opening the joint meeting, the boys
should be lined up ready to begin the minstrel.</p>

<p class='c004'>While the boys are busy reading for the minstrel,
the Cubmaster meets with all parents. Since the
January Pack Leaders’ meeting will probably take
place before the January Pack meeting, plans will
probably be well established for the Blue and Gold
party in February.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Cubmaster should explain Blue and Gold
plans to parents, doing his best to build their
enthusiasm for making it the high spot of the
entire year. He should explain the way in which
food will be handled, announce the names of those
who will serve on committees, etc.</p>

</div>
<p class='c016'><b>Tips For Your Pack Minstrels</b></p>
<p class='c004'><span class='c007'>◆</span> <i>Program and Publicity</i>: Plan an
attractive mimeographed announcement
for your show, and deliver it to parents
in advance.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Costumes</i>: Almost anything goes. In some
minstrels all actors are blackface. This appeals
to boys, although it presents problems
for the make-up crew. Blackface
make-up may be bought at most drug
stores. Burnt cork is an old favorite. In
many minstrel shows the cast remains in
white-face with simple costumes, while
the end men wear bright, comic costumes
and blackfaces. Either way is good, so take
your choice.... It’s a good idea to have all
boys except the end men dressed alike.
If they are to be blackfaced, have each
bring a black sock which can be pulled
tight over the head to hide the hair. A
white shirt with a black tie (cloth or paper),
black trousers and socks, and dark
shoes complete the costume. It also adds a
nice effect if every boy can wear white
gloves. Even white canvas work gloves
will serve nicely.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Stage Setting</i>: If you have a fairly good-sized
stage, try to arrange chairs or benches
on different levels so that all performers
can be seen. Decorate the back of the stage
with large paper musical notes pasted on
a background of paper, and perhaps a
sign reading “Welcome.”... Footlights
and spotlights help the show but are not
necessary for success. You can buy spot
bulbs at hardware stores.... Even without
a stage, you can arrange your chairs or
benches on different levels so that you
have the effect of a stage.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Program</i>: Plan your program so you
don’t need the entire Pack at rehearsals.
Features which will be participated in by the
entire cast (for example, opening and
closing chorus), can be rehearsed by each Den,
then sung together at the show. Here are some
good numbers for your opening chorus: “Dixie,”
“Minstrel Days,” “We’re Here For Fun” (see page
6, <i>Cub Scout Song Book</i>), “Hello, Hello, Hello,”
“When You Wore A Tulip,” “Down South,” etc....
Each Den can prepare whatever acts time will allow,
and ought to supply at least two solos, either
vocal or instrumental. Solos can be alternated with
the Den stunts. The stunts can include such items
as homemade orchestras, Den chorus, Den tap
dance, Den skits, etc.... Much of the success depends
upon the end men. Two or four sit on each
side of the front line and pass jokes and stories
back and forth with the interlocutor. The interlocutor
can be either an adult or boy, and it is his
job to keep the show running smoothly and to
prompt those who forget their cues. Most libraries
have several books on minstrel shows, and you will
find some good stories in them. Give them a local
twist and they will seem funnier.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Remember</i>: Your minstrel show can succeed
without rehearsals of the entire cast if you plan
carefully. It won’t be quite so polished as a professional
minstrel show might be, but your parents
and guests will enjoy it all the same, and will
appreciate the fact that you did not require the
boys to go out for special rehearsals.</p>

</div>
<p class='c021'><b>UNICORD</b></p>
<p class='c004'>A cigar box and four-foot
stick, an “E” string, an old
fiddle bow and a few nails
will make it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Be sure to remove paper
from cigar box so it will
sound. Make a bow out of
stick and horse hair with
resin on it, or borrow an old
fiddle bow.</p>

<p class='c004'>Slide flat metal bar up and
down string to make different
notes.</p>
<div  class='figright id006'>
<img src='images/i18b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c021'><b>MUSICAL CANS</b></p>
<p class='c004'>Four 2-qt., four 1-qt. and four 1-pt. cans
with different amounts of water to make
a musical scale.</p>

<p class='c004'>The more water and the larger the
can the lower the note. The less water
and the smaller the can, the higher the
note.</p>

<p class='c004'>Put three pieces of sliced cork on the
bottom of each can to lift it above table
top. Strike with cork hammer.</p>
<div  class='figleft id006'>
<img src='images/i18c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c021'><b>MARIMBA STICKS OR SLATS</b></p>
<p class='c004'>Dry California Redwood or poplar slats are good.
The longer or thicker they are, the lower the note
or pitch. The shorter or thinner they are, the higher
the note or pitch.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cut shorter or thin down the slats until you have
a musical scale.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lay tuned slats across a cardboard box.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sprinkle sawdust on them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Strike lightly and rapidly in center. The sawdust
will gather in two places. These are the spots where
there is practically no vibration. Drive your nails
through these spots in attaching to ropes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hold rope by loop and strike slats with hammer
made from a stick and a spool padded with cloth.</p>
<div  class='figleft id014'>
<img src='images/i18d.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c021'>BAMBOO PAN PIPES
Bamboo tubes with diameter
from ⅜ in. to ¼ in.
1st tube about 7 in. long.</p>

<p class='c004'>Leave joint at bottom to
close it. Grind and cut
bamboo tubes shorter and
shorter until you get the
right note when blown.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another way: Test tubes
bound together and partly
filled with clay will give
different depths and different
notes of the scale.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='c007'>◆</span> Someone asked for volunteers to take over
a Den one night at our Pack 58 meeting. Bewildered
and afraid, my wife said she would try.
After all, there were just six youngsters from
around our block and they were all nine years old
and anxious to get a start in Cub Scouting. The
man in charge of the Pack meeting said it would
be nice if one of the dads would act as Den Dad,
so having three boys of my own, out went my neck
and there I was ... Den Dad of Den 5, Pack 58.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys learned the Cub Scout Law and Promise,
and they also learned that discipline was the
first word in the language. In due time this became
a part of their regular activities. They learned
fast, because when they were obedient they were
rewarded with special trips or treats. And because
one fellow’s misbehavior penalized all the
others, they learned by living that the “buddy system”
really works.</p>

<p class='c004'>Our Den meetings always came first. The program
was planned so that each boy could advance
within the six month period, and the achievements
were geared into the program so that what we did
as fun also resulted in advancement. And we
didn’t have any spoiled boys at 11½ either, because
our program helped them grow into Scouting.</p>

<p class='c004'>Our Denners were elected by democratic vote,
with ability, interest, and progress as the prerequisites.
Believe me, it worked, and we never had
any real problem with our Denners ... either
before, during, or after they took office.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yes, our Den had its problems. I remember one
boy who just couldn’t read. His athletic ability was
nil but you should have seen his beautiful art work.
Another boy was a bully, but one day one of the
little fellows, who had practiced diligently for
weeks, used a swell one-two punch during a Den
parents’ meeting show, and the bully never gave
us any trouble again. In fact, he became one of
the fairest, squarest shooters in the Den. Any personal
problem of any of our boys was handled
secretly by the Den Mother, and many a mother
called to express her grateful thanks for help in
home problems involving her son.</p>

<p class='c004'>We were pretty regular in our recognition for
handicrafts and attendance at the monthly Pack
meeting, and our skits and stunts were mighty
good. The highest honor ever given any of us was
when we were invited to present our puppets at
the Council Cubbers Pow Wow. One of the mothers
of the Den made puppets as her hobby, and after a
while every boy in the Den was in the act in the
many stories we told with these little acting dolls.</p>

<p class='c004'>Every one of our boys was taught to mend his
clothes and do simple cooking. He learned a lot of
handicrafts, but most of all he learned to be clean
in every sense, and to be courteous and friendly.</p>

<p class='c004'>All of this happened during the war years ...
at a time when most folks were singing the blues
that we couldn’t get leaders ... that we were too
busy to worry about the little fellows ... that we
had a war to win and nothing else counted.</p>

<p class='c004'>All true stories must come to an end. But my
wife and I had our real thank-you as Den Mother
and Den Dad when twelve of our thirteen Cub
Scouts graduated with Webelos Honors into Scouting,
and even the thirteenth, the lad who couldn’t
learn to read, graduated too, though without the
added honor of the Arrow of Light on his uniform.
The last time we checked, ten of our boys were
still in Scouting, and four of them will come up for
their Eagle Rank together at the next Court of
Honor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of course, as Den Dad I did a behind-the-scenes
job, but I worked closely with the Den Mother even
though I couldn’t often attend the afternoon Den
meetings.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yessir, I was a Den Dad. All three of my boys
are in Scouting, one an Eagle Scout with Palms,
one a Star Scout, and the third a Wolf Cub Scout
heading for Bear. My wife? She is still a Scout
widow as I continue to be active in our District,
but she shares with me the thrill of seeing her
boys receive honor after honor in the best boy
program on earth ... Scouting.</p>

... be a Den Dad. It’s fun!!!</p>

</div>
<p class='c016'><span class='c007'>◆</span> Most of the following Den suggestions come
from material developed by Mr. and Mrs.
Robert Starr of Corning, New York. The material
was used as a part of their “Fun With Music”
Theme.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id015'>
<img src='images/i20-1.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c020'><i>Pre-Opening.</i> Play some spirited patriotic records
and marches on a phonograph. Feature a
march such as the “Marine Hymn,” and each Den
can make up its own words. This project can extend
through all four Den meetings.</p>
<p class='c004'>For music during the pre-opening Mrs. Starr
recommends Decca Album number 50, “Patriotic
Songs For Children.”</p>
<p class='c003'><i>Opening.</i> Use phonograph or piano to accompany
the boys in the “Star Spangled Banner.”</p>
<p class='c004'><i>Business Items.</i> Leaders explain Music and Minstrels
theme and discuss Den’s part in minstrel
show. This need not be finally determined until
next Den Meeting.</p>
<p class='c003'><i>Activities.</i> Pin pictures of musical instruments
on boys’ backs. They ask questions of each other
which can be answered “yes” or “no” until each
discovers the name of the instrument he wears.</p>
<p class='c004'>Practice the song the Pack has chosen for chorus
of minstrel show. Also practice any other general
songs to be used in the show.</p>
<p class='c016'><i>Closing.</i> Sing again the closing chorus for the
minstrel show.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id015'>
<img src='images/i20-2.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c021'><i>Pre-Opening.</i> Tell the story of some special music
or composer such as Stephen Foster.</p>
<p class='c016'><i>Opening.</i> Sing one of the choruses to be used
in the Pack minstrel show.</p>
<p class='c016'><i>Business Items.</i> Den Mother leads Den in discussion
to decide what the Den will do at the Pack
minstrel show.</p>
<p class='c016'><i>Activities.</i> Spend some time working as a group
on words for the song chosen at the first meeting.
Try some musical charades. Each Cub Scout acts
out the title of a song while others guess its name.
After the name is guessed the Cub leads his Den in
the song. Rehearse Den’s part in minstrel show.</p>
<p class='c016'><i>Closing.</i> Teach the Cub Scouts an old time spiritual
such as “Swing Low Sweet Chariot” and
“Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho.” The <i>Fireside
Book of Songs</i>, published by Simon &amp; Schuster,
will give Den Mothers lots of ideas.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id015'>
<img src='images/i20-3.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c021'><i>Pre-Opening.</i> Pick a simple radio theme song
such as the “Duz” song and let each boy write his
own words for the music. Here is what one Cub
Scout in Mr. Starr’s Pack composed:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c023'>

      <div class='line'>Cubs can stand the test you see.</div>
      <div class='line'>When you ask them why this is,</div>
      <div class='line'>They say we’ll try anything.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><i>Opening.</i> All teach their songs to the Den.</p>
<p class='c016'><i>Business Items.</i> Den Mother and Den Chief check
up on costumes, properties, etc., for Pack minstrel
show.</p>
<p class='c016'><i>Activities.</i> Musical Guessing Game. One Cub
Scout sings a song silently in front of the Den
while others try to read his lips. As each Cub Scout
guesses the song, he joins the first boy and sings
the song silently with him. When everyone has
guessed the song, the Den sings it aloud. Play another
game of your own choice unrelated to the
musical theme. Rehearse the Den’s part for the
minstrel show. It should be really polished this
time. Also rehearse the choruses which are to be
sung by the entire cast.</p>
<p class='c016'><i>Closing.</i> Sing a quiet song such as “Now the Day
Is Over.”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id015'>
<img src='images/i20-4.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c021'><i>Pre-Opening.</i> Hold a dress rehearsal for the minstrel
show. During the pre-opening, Cub Scouts
put on their minstrel show costumes. Blackface
is not necessary for the rehearsal.</p>
<p class='c016'><i>Opening.</i> Rather than follow through with the
formal Den meeting, use time to rehearse the Den’s
acts for the minstrel show. Teach Cub Scouts some
rounds. Mr. and Mrs. Starr recommend the <i>Blue
Book</i> published by Hall &amp; McCreary Co. Good
rounds are: “Scotland’s Burning,” “Sweetly Sings
the Donkey,” “Row Row Row Your Boat,” “Three
Blind Mice” and “Are You Sleeping?”</p>
<p class='c016'><i>Closing.</i> Rehearse the Den song which was composed
by the boys at the first Den Meeting.</p>

1888, priced at $2.)</p>

<p class='c004'>Cub Scouts will also find the Cub Scout Puzzle
Box interesting. The box is filled with the sort of
tricks boys can try on their dads. The Puzzle Kit
may also be purchased through your Boy Scout
dealer or ordered through the Boy Scout Office.
(Catalog No. 1887, price $2.)</p>

<p class='c004'>Both of these Kits would make wonderful Christmas
gifts for Cub Scouts.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>GOT A GAME?</b></p>
<p class='c004'>A lot of digging goes on before the Cub Scouting
section of <span class='sc'>Scouting</span> Magazine reaches you
each month. We do our best to make available to
you information which will help you in the planning
of your Pack programs. Naturally we cannot
give you enough to make it unnecessary for
you to do some thinking too. Our purpose is to
give you just enough information to stimulate
your own thinking and planning.</p>

<p class='c004'>One of the areas where we need some help is
that of games. We can keep passing games along to
you, but we would like to be able to give you
games which other Cub Scout leaders have successfully
used in their Dens and Packs. The only
way we can do that is for you to send us the favorite
games of your Den.</p>

<p class='c004'>Would it help you if we were to start a Favorite
Games Department? Perhaps we could print two
or three favorite games each month. You would
know that they were games which had been successfully
used in Cub Scouting in some section of
the country.</p>

<p class='c004'>Would you like such a favorite games column in
your <span class='sc'>Scouting</span> Magazine? If so, send us your favorite
game, and we will consider it your vote in
favor of the Department. Tell us just enough about
your game so that we can
understand it. You need
not worry about making it
polished writing. We’ll edit
it. If the game you send us
has not been used in our
literature, and if it’s the
type of game we can use,
then we will publish it and
give you credit for sending
it.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='c007'>⚜</span> <b>Troop Announcements</b></p>

<p class='c004'>Scoutmasters who are also photographers, or
who have photographers on the Troop Committee
or among their obliging friends, have an easy way
of turning out interest-catching cards announcing
Troop meetings, hikes, and other events.</p>

<p class='c004'>Use a snapshot of a recent hike or camp. Print
the photo in one corner of a piece of photographic
paper, cut to post card size, (or a regular postcard
photo stock sold in many shops). Write the
announcement in the white space surrounding the
picture, stick on a one cent stamp, and leave the
rest to Uncle Sam. The sample above shows the
type of card sent out by Scoutmaster S. L. Lenington,
of Troop 207, Denison, Texas. He says it
works nicely.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>Stop That Hacking</b></p>
<p class='c004'>When the Meshingomesia Council Camp Staff,
of Marion, Indiana, began to take stock of the
trees in camp, their observations rocked them right
to the ground. Not that Scouts were intentionally
destructive—but careless hacking, needless bark
stripping, and the typical American habit of carving
initials on anything and everything in sight—all
had been combined to completely ruin some
trees, partly destroy others, and at the very least,
deface the natural beauty of the woods.</p>

<p class='c004'>Several schemes were suggested to stop these
careless habits, and one proved most successful.
Whenever a batch of campers arrived, they were
lined up with their axes and knives in front of
them. Each Scout gave the Scout Sign and repeated
“On my honor I do promise to protect all plants
and animals in our Scout Camp, being particularly
careful with my knife and axe, not cutting any
tree or shrub without permission.”</p>
<p class='c016'><b>Bugs and Flowers</b></p>
<p class='c004'>Scoutmasters who are embarrassed when eager
beavers run up and ask “What kind of a bug is
this?” or “What flower is that?” will welcome two
new books, both published by Doubleday and
Company, Garden City, New York.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>The Insect Guide</i> by Dr. Ralph B. Swain, a
former Scout, is a very-easy-to-use book. Instead
of describing the individual species, Dr. Swain tells
how to recognize the larger, more easily remembered
insect families and orders. Four hundred and
fifty illustrations—330 in full color, make the job
of question-answering that much easier. Equally
interesting is the material on how to find, capture,
observe and preserve different insects. As a hike
or camp activity, insect observation can be good
program material, if you know how to do it. This
pocket guide supplies the answers.</p>

<p class='c004'>Also recommended for the Troop library is <i>Wild
Flower Guide</i>, by Dr. Edgar T. Wherry. Actual use
with Scouts has proved this to be an easy-to-follow
guide. For example: if you find a flower and
wonder what it is, refer to the appendix, where
flowers are classified according to color. Run down
the list and eliminate those which you know the
flower isn’t. Then look for possibilities of what it
might be. The illustrations, many in color, make
the job easier. The description of each flower is
complete.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='c007'>⚜</span> We start getting a dad’s interest when his
boy joins the Troop. The boy is invited to a
meeting by a Scout. We make him welcome, tell
him to look us over and we’ll look him over too.
After he’s been to a meeting or two we talk to him
about passing Tenderfoot tests, and tell him when
he’s ready to come to our home. We ask him to
bring dad along to meet us.</p>

<p class='c004'>So, the evening we’ve both agreed upon arrives.
So does the Scout-to-be and his dad. We set them
at ease and start to pass the boy on his tests. He’s
ready all right and does a good job, and we make
it a point to let him know it. Then we tell of the
2nd Class requirements, how simple they are to
pass, and how with a little bit of help from dad
there is no reason why he shouldn’t be Eagle in
a couple of years.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dad, pleased that his son is on the first step of
Scouting, is in a receptive mood, so we go on to
explain the fun in Scouting for man and boy, how
winter camps are the highlight of our Troop activities
and how other dads go along on these camps.</p>

<p class='c004'>Our Troop registers about thirty-six Scouts every
year and this year we registered twenty-four dads.
They are Scouters and take an active interest in
problems confronting the Committee. On the average,
we have no less than fifteen dads at every
monthly Committee meeting. Not everyone can
make every meeting, but all can and do pitch in
whenever we have a special project to work on.</p>

<p class='c004'>For instance, we needed money to buy camping
equipment a year or so ago. One dad took over
as chairman of the project which turned out to
be a waste paper and magazine drive. He rallied
twenty-eight Scouts and twenty dads and their
cars. We put $250 into the Troop treasury and had
a swell time doing it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Four of the dads on the Troop Committee act as
a Board of Review for the Troop. Then at the subsequent
Court of Honor this same group along
with other members of the Committee sit on the
Court and make the awards. At these Courts of
Honor we make it a point to invite and expect
every mother and dad to attend—even though
their son may not be up for an award. We know he
will be at a future Court, and know his mother and
dad would want the same cooperation and interest
shown by other parents.</p>

<p class='c004'>As I’ve said, we like to go camping, to spend
long week-ends in the woods, and when one of
these week-ends comes along another dad steps
into the picture. He’s our Transportation Chairman
and it’s his job to see that the Scouts get to and
from camp.</p>

<p class='c004'>Because our dads come from every walk of life
and all kinds of businesses, we look into their daily
jobs or hobbies for special talents that might be
employed at a Troop meeting. One of our dads is
Lieutenant Commander in the Coast Guard, so
some weekend this fall the Troop will take a trip
and visit the local Coast Guard Station and see
how it is operated, and incidentally look over and
into the workings of a submarine stationed there.</p>

<p class='c004'>No you won’t get them all. You’ll run across
the dad who just can’t do much because of his job,
and you’ll run across the dad just not interested—even
the fellow who is most willing to have you
take the boys to camp, his boy included, and not
even be able to lend a hand with transportation.
Don’t let these few discourage you however, nor
cause you to slacken your efforts to ask the next
dad who comes along. Don’t be afraid to go out
and ask for help. Give your dads a chance and
you’ll have more fun in Scouting, you’ll have a
better Troop and you’ll have an easier job.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='c007'>⚜</span> January is essentially a month of preparation
for Scout anniversary week, and since local
activities vary so much over the country, it is
difficult to suggest four weekly meetings that will
be usable by every Troop. Some Units will devote
the entire month to preparation for window displays
and live expos, open-house nights, Scout
Sunday, participation in Council or District activities
and other events celebrating Scouting’s birthday.
Other Troops will be able to carry on such
preparation, and still spend time on training in some
skill or series of Scoutcraft projects.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>SCOUT WEEK <i>Adventure</i><br /><span class='large'><i>By William E. Lawrence</i></span><br /> <span class='small'>Director of Boy Scouting</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'><span class='large'><b><i>In Fun and Fellowship</i></b></span></p>

<p class='c004'>It seems strange that FUN must be emphasized
as a feature of Scouting. For that’s what
Scouts expect when they join a Troop. That’s
what they must get if we are going to keep
them interested ... but it should be fun with
a purpose, a dignified sort of fun that Scouts
will always remember.</p>

<p class='c004'>New games and inter-Patrol contests; better
Patrol and Troop meetings; stunt nights; special
features, such as Troop attendance at the
big basketball game or a Troop swim at the
school or “Y” pool; wide games on every hike
and camp; these are only some ways to make
Scouting fun.</p>

<p class='c004'>And don’t overlook fellowship. One way to
stimulate wholesome companionship is to see
to it that every boy is in the Patrol where he
fits—in a Patrol where he has friends, common
interests with the other fellows, a leader
he will gladly follow, activities he
helps to plan and responsibilities
he has to carry out for the welfare
of his gang.</p>

<p class='c004'>THERE IS adventure in fun and
fellowship and it’s up to us to provide
opportunities for it.</p>
<p class='c003'><span class='large'><b><i>In the Out-of-Doors</i></b></span></p>

<p class='c004'>Many times, when boys drop out of Scouting
they tell us it is because “we didn’t go
hiking or camping often enough” or “our program
is always the same old stuff.” Scouts
want to go OUT. We must take them out—out
where they can master the skills of the
pioneer, explorer, woodsman, or sportsman.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scouting has the program for the out-of-doors—hiking
and camping. But let’s make
it hiking and camping with a purpose—to
explore wilderness areas, catch bigger fish,
track wild animals, tramp the trails of the old
pioneers. Let’s help Scouts learn outdoor skills—but
then, let’s give them a chance to use
those skills in seeking adventure.</p>

<p class='c004'>Every Scout has the right to a rugged outdoor
experience, for Scouting means outdoor
adventure.</p>
<p class='c017'><span class='c007'>⚜</span> “Adventure—that’s Scouting.” But what is
adventure? Webster says that it’s “That which
happens without design ... hazard ... a bold undertaking
... a remarkable occurrence ... a striking
event ... a stirring incident.”</p>

<p class='c004'>To adult minds such a definition conjures up
visions ... leaving the commonplace, going into
the unknown. And ... most of us find it only in
reading about the great and hazardous adventures
of others.</p>

<p class='c004'>We go with Perry and Stefansson to the Arctic or
with Shackleton, Amundsen, Scott and Byrd to the
Antarctic.</p>

<p class='c004'>We go up the Mississippi with DeSoto or down it
with LaSalle.</p>

<p class='c004'>Or we thrill to the determination, courage and
excitement in the conquest of Mt. Everest, or in
flying faster than sound.</p>

<p class='c004'>Perhaps we as adults have few things happen to
us now that we call adventures. But ... let’s not
forget that adventure is a relative thing.</p>

<p class='c004'>A boy may put up a front of being sophisticated
but he hasn’t lived long enough to get around
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>much. There are still plenty of bold undertakings,
remarkable occurrences and stirring incidents
ahead for him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Can’t you recall some of your own early adventures?
They’d seem pretty tame to you now ... but
were they then?</p>

<p class='c004'>Within the last few years I have hiked and
camped in some of the places where I hiked and
camped as a Scout. I’ve been surprised to find that
the forests are now only small wooded areas ...
the mountains I climbed just hills ... the wide
lakes hardly more than ponds.</p>

<p class='c004'>Adventure to a boy is something that is new and
different ... a change of surroundings ... experiencing
new things in new ways.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is this promise of adventure ... of camping
and of life in the outdoors that lures the boy into
Scouting.</p>

<p class='c004'>We must keep faith with him by giving him that
adventure ... not just to satisfy him but because
it is the best way we have of holding his interest.
And ... only as we hold his interest can we influence
his development.</p>

<p class='c004'>But if we give a boy a good, old-fashioned, rugged
brand of Scouting ... if we teach him to take
care of himself ... if once a month we take him
to a not-too-distant spot with a pack on his back
... have him sleep on the ground and cook his
meals ... he will have adventure.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here, with his Patrol and Troop he will establish
a temporary settlement. He will meet the problems
of shelter and food and learn to get along with his
fellows. Every new experience will bring new
problems to be solved.</p>

<p class='c004'>As he grows in ability, his experiences can become
longer and more difficult and thus more adventurous.
Opportunities to live outdoors in rain
and snow should be sought. In this way he may
learn additional skills which come only from living
with, and mastering difficulties.</p>

<p class='c004'>When he can light a fire and keep warm with
wet wood, pitch his tent, and make his bed in a
rainstorm ... then he will have had adventures
and through them learned a lot about self reliance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Remember Webster’s definition ... “a bold undertaking
... a remarkable occurrence ... a striking
event ... a stirring incident.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They are all there. You can find them as you
work and plan your Troop program.</p>

<p class='c004'>If you do, you will help boys to know themselves.
You will develop in them a feeling of responsibility
toward others. You will go far toward
enriching the life of a boy through his Scouting
experience.</p>

<p class='c004'>This can be <i>your</i> “bold undertaking” ... your
“striking event” ... your “stirring incident.” This
can be your adventure in Scouting!</p>

<p class='c004'>Five adventure highlights for Boy Scout Week
are spotlighted below. Start them in February, but
keep going the rest of the year. These are the elements
which will bring adventure to the boys in
your Troop.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Everybody loves a BIG SHOW—almost
every scout gets a kick out of
performing for his family, friends and
neighbors. The special events suggested
for Boy Scout Week give
Scouts a chance to be recognized.</p>

<p class='c004'>Feb. 6th—Scout Sunday—attend
religious services in uniform and
take part in the service.</p>

<p class='c004'>Feb. 8th—Anniversary Day—revive
the custom of re-pledging oneself
to the Scout Oath and Law at
8:15 p.m. Scouts all over the country
will be doing the same thing at the
same time.</p>

<p class='c004'>Feb. 7-11—Troop Meeting night—Open
House program. (Get the new
“Open House” booklet from your
Local Council.) Fun, demonstrations,
recognition of advancement,
Report to parents and parent institutions
on Adventure in Citizenship.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scouting in schools—assembly
program and demonstration.</p>

<p class='c004'>Feb. 12th—A day in the open—hike
or camp activities appropriate
for locality and individual Troop.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c001'>
    <div><span class='xlarge'><b><i>In Citizenship</i></b></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Remember last year’s Report to the
Nation when Troops reported on their
service projects for the coming year—1948?
This is the pay-off year, when
we report on what we did instead of
what we plan to do. This is the time to
check up on your community Good
Turns, service to your sponsor, and
other service projects. Plan new and
bigger activities for Scout Week—1949,
and for the rest of the year. But
don’t stop with plans—do something!</p>

<p class='c004'>There is adventure in Citizenship
when Scouts come to realize that they
are citizens of the world too. There is
no better time to revive an interest in
the World Friendship Fund to help
Scouts in other lands. Food packages
are more important than ever.</p>

<p class='c004'>Review now the results of our
promises—and make even more
challenging ones for 1949.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c001'>
    <div><span class='xlarge'><b><i>In Leadership</i></b></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Every Scoutmaster knows how important
his junior leaders are—Patrol
Leaders, Senior Patrol Leader, Junior
Assistant Scoutmaster, Scribe and
others. This hard working staff comes
in for little credit except on rare occasions.
It will boost their morale, raise
them a little higher in the esteem of
their fellows if they are properly recognized
for their leadership jobs. It
will point up to parents and friends
the way Scouting helps boys develop
their latent leadership ability.</p>

<p class='c004'>Den Chiefs, too, should be recognized
for the important part they play—recognized
in the Troop, before fellow Scouts, parents and friends.</p>

<p class='c004'>A special investiture for Troop leaders
at the Open House, or another
special occasion would be the ideal
way to recognize this leadership.
Make it short, make it impressive.
Make the Scouts feel that they are appreciated.
Point up their work as adventure in living—as well as adventure
in Scouting.</p>

</div>
<div  class='figleft id006'>
<img src='images/i27a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p><i>By William H. Wadsworth</i><br />Asst. Scout Executive, Onandaga Council, Syracuse, N.Y.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c003'><span class='c007'>⚜</span> There are two ways to get the know-how of
winter camping. One is the hard way, by
trial and error, the other is profiting by the experience
of others. We did it the hard way, which has
certain advantages; once you learn a trick, you
don’t forget it. But, we’re happy to let you in the
easy way, so let’s take first things first:</p>
<div  class='figleft id006'>
<img src='images/i27b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c021'><b>Packing</b></p>
<p class='c004'>We usually have each Patrol get personal equipment
together and lay it out in neat piles. Patrol
equipment and food is divided equally into as
many piles as Scouts in the Patrol. We consider
both weight and bulk, and try to even it up.</p>

<p class='c004'>It’s a good idea to fill your cook pots (we use five
No. 10 cans) with food or small articles which
might possibly be greasy, or break or freeze, and
place in the top of your pack. If blankets are on
the outside (get them inside if possible) protect
them from the weather by rolling in waterproof
groundcloth. Don’t have the end of your blanket
roll exposed. (We found we could keep the Patrol
canteen from freezing by putting it in the middle
of a bedroll.)</p>
<div  class='figleft id006'>
<img src='images/i27c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c021'><b>Clothing and Equipment</b></p>
<p class='c004'>As you travel and begin to heat up, peel off layers
of clothing. Several layers are warmer than a few
heavy pieces. This goes for socks as well as shirts.
Air space gives good insulation. If it’s raining or
snowing, be sure to wear a water-repellent outer
garment, removing the inner layers and packing
them in the flap of your pack. You’ll want them—dry—later
at night. In snow country, specially
after a fresh snowfall, you’ll find a large amount of
snow constantly dropping off trees onto your pack,
your back, and down your neck. Carry a small stiff
brush to remove it. Keep the brush handy in an
outside pocket for removing snow from clothes
and equipment. “It’s easier to keep ’Em dry than to
dry ’Em out!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Damp socks may be dried during the night by
laying them flat across your stomach outside whatever
night clothing you are wearing. In cold country,
shoes should be dried before the fire and
placed inside or under your bedroll for the night.
I’ll never forget the time we had the first really
cold night and left our ski boots outside the bedroll.
They were like rocks and it took some time to
soften them enough to get our feet in them.</p>

<p class='c004'>We are strong believers in the Swedish bow saw
in country where we do a great deal of wood
cutting. We cut bed logs to hold the dead leaves,
boughs, or grass. We cut poles for our tents and
reflector fires. We cut large base logs on which to
build the fire to keep it from burning itself out of
sight in deep snow. I’ll never forget the day we
“lost our fire” when we were on a day hike. We
were in a large frozen swamp and had made fires
to cook our lunch. You should have seen the expression
on one face when, with a hiss and sputter
of steam, his fire disappeared into the water, leaving
his hot dog dangling above floating charcoal.</p>

<p class='c004'>One reason for emphasis on the bow saw, is that
it does twice the work with half the energy. Wood
fills with frost in winter and axes bounce instead
of cut, no matter how sharp they may be.</p>

<p class='c004'>In winter look for just the opposite type of
campsite you would select in summer. Instead of
a shaded open knoll, seek low lands, if they are
frozen, where trees are thick and provide good
windbreak. Places you never visit in summer suddenly
come into their own for winter camping.</p>

<p class='c004'>A small roll of copper wire will come in handy
for many things. One fellow always carries about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>four wire pothooks of varying sizes. Oh yes, he
can make a wood pothook, but that takes time,
and often when we have made camp a little late
because of a long trip or late start, his pothooks
come in mighty handy. He also added pot bags to
our list. Strange as it may seem, we don’t have one
Scout who likes to wash the black off pots; thus,
if we are making only one camp, we just crush the
#10 cans and bury them. When we use a regular
pot, we just wash the inside, pack it full of other
food and equipment, and slip on the pot bag, which
prevents it from dirtying up our pack.</p>
<div  class='figleft id006'>
<img src='images/i28.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>by Remington Schuyler</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c021'><b>Tents</b></p>
<p class='c004'>Tentage is a story in itself. We use the Tab tent
(<span class='sc'>Scouting</span>, December, 1947), which is a rectangular,
suspended tent. It has thirty-seven tabs which
give us a chance to pitch it in many different ways,
each providing twenty-inch walls, which make for
more room and efficient use of the tent’s interior.
For winter camping we pitch it with an open front
in either winter baker, forester, or explorer style,
using forty-penny nails or logs to anchor it on
frozen ground, or logs or sticks buried in deep
snow. We like logs best; the same logs can be used
for bed logs with the Tab tent. We bank the tent
well with grass, leaves, or snow—for that wind
can whistle under an open edge too easily.</p>

<p class='c004'>We have a favorite tripod fire crane which works
perfectly under any conditions—frozen ground, in
snow, or mud. It eliminates cutting crotched sticks
and pounding them into hard or frozen ground.
The three uprights may be dead or live wood fastened
at the top with a small piece of rope, wire,
or even a neckerchief. The lug pole is green wood
about an inch in diameter. This rig can be easily
moved as your fire changes, and works well with
any type of fire lay.</p>

<p class='c004'>Don’t forget a small food cloth for keeping food
and cooking equipment off the ground. Keep one
pot on the fire for a constant hot water supply; it
will come in handy in a dozen ways and is an
excellent first aid precaution. It is easier to melt
snow in water than in a bare pot where it must
be stirred to keep from burning. Let each individual
prepare his own beverage with boiling water
and the beverage powder he prefers. This saves
tying up another pot.</p>

<p class='c004'>A good ground cloth is essential. Make it large
enough to go under and over your bedroll. Build
your bed of dried leaves, grass, or boughs. Don’t
rely on that summer sleeping bag alone—extra
blankets are necessary. Newspapers are good insulation.
Sleep with your head to the highest part
of the tent so that your breath won’t freeze and
form a hoarfrost on the tent and fall off onto your
blankets.</p>

<p class='c004'>One fellow hit on a good idea on our last
trip. At night he prepared his tinder, kindling,
and firewood in three neat piles inside his tent.
When morning came, he extended one arm, in
went the kindling, a match, and it’s lighted, with
him still in bed. A stick or two of wood and things
began to warm up. By the time he had to get up,
he didn’t miss his warm blankets ... well, not
much.</p>

<p class='c004'>We carry two pairs of long underwear. The one
worn during the day is taken off and dried at night
when going to bed and when it is warm. The next
morning clothes are put on over the set of underwear
worn during the night, eliminating too much
exposure of bare skin—an important point, especially
when you are inside that bare skin.</p>

<p class='c004'>First aid precautions in cold weather differ from
regular summer first aid; shock is greatly intensified
in cold weather. Blankets and canteen hot
water bottle are handy. How to treat for frostbite
is required knowledge. Make preparations against
snow blindness in northern regions. Temporary
sunglasses may be made with cardboard, cloth, or
wood with slits cut through, fastened in place with
adhesive tape. Watch out for your feet. Wear several
layers of light wool socks with large sized
waterproof shoes, shoe packs, or ski boots. Tight-fitting
ski boots will cause you trouble. Lay down
boughs or branches around your fire; you can walk
on them and thus keep your feet out of wet
snow or mud caused by the fire’s heat.</p>

<p class='c004'>You’ll pick up other ideas as you go along. It’s
not difficult, and you don’t need special equipment
or skill. All you need is the spirit of adventure—the
spirit your Scouts have—and the desire to try
something different. It’s fun.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'><span class='xxlarge'><b><i>THE EARLY SCOUT GETS THE BIRD</i></b></span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'><span class='c007'>⚜</span> Killing two birds with one stone may have
been satisfactory in the old days, but in these
days of inflation we figured we should be able to
knock off at least six birds, figuratively speaking
of course.</p>

<p class='c004'>It all started at a Committee meeting when we
were looking around for a Scout Week window display
idea. A mass display of bluebird houses made
by the Scouts was suggested. But just making
birdhouses as a craft project did not seem too practical,
unless we could put the houses to use and get
birds to nest in them. But why couldn’t we do that?
We could. We did. And this is how it worked:</p>
<div class='sans fs70'>

<div  class='figleft id006'>
<img src='images/i29a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>Boards were cut and kits were assembled in the basement workshops of Committeemen and friends.<br /><span class='small'><i>Wolf Photo</i></span></p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c017'>First of all, each
Committeeman
made one birdhouse,
using the
pattern shown here
and an old apple
crate or scrap lumber.
That was to
prepare the Committeeman to help
the boys. It also gave us a start with ten houses.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then each Scout was given a copy of the pattern
and asked to make a house in the next week. Most
of the fellows came through and we had twenty
more. Now we were ready for mass production.</p>

<p class='c004'>We scouted the lumberyards in town, and the
building projects for scrap lumber—1″ thick
boards in various lengths and widths. Everyone
was cooperative and we got all the wood we
needed. We bought the nails, and then looked
around for a “basement shop” or woodworking
hobbyist to help us prefabricate the birdhouses.
The power saw was easily found, and we went to
work sawing up the boards to the proper sizes.</p>
<div class='sans fs70'>

<div  class='figleft id006'>
<img src='images/i29b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>Birdhouses were used first in Scout Week window display and later were placed out in orchard country.<br /><span class='small'><i>Frederick Avery Photo</i></span><br /><span class='small'><i>Wolf Photo</i></span></p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c017'>Then we tied up the boards into “kits,” each kit
containing all the makings of a house. In Patrol
Meetings, the Scouts assembled the houses. That
gave us something over 150 more houses.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>Window Display</b></p>
<p class='c004'>When the houses were complete, just before
Scout Week, we gathered them all together and
built our window display. The photo shows what
it looked like. But the photo doesn’t show all the
interest it aroused.</p>
<p class='c016'><b>Mapping</b></p>
<p class='c004'>The craft work “bird” and the window display
were knocked off—now for setting up the houses.
The Buffalo Ornithological Society helped us, and
we placed them along fifty miles of highways radiating
out from town. The houses were placed in
orchard country, with the approval of the land
owners. Each group made a sketch map of the
roads along which they set up houses, and we put
the segments together to make a large map showing
the location of all the houses.</p>
<div class='sans fs70'>

<div  class='figleft id006'>
<img src='images/i29c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>A map was made to show the location of each birdhouse so that check-ups could be made during the nesting season.<br /><span class='small'><i>Wolf Photo</i></span></p>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c029'><b>Bird Study</b></p>
<p class='c030'>Of course the chief purpose of the project was
to attract birds and provide nesting places for
them. So two more “birds” fell before our one
stone. Weekly hikes, during the spring, gave Scouts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>a chance to see how successful the housing development
was. Every house was checked and the
tenants carefully observed. Landlords can’t be too
careful these days. We found that we housed more
than 400 young birds.</p>
<div class='sans'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c031'>
    <div><span class='xxlarge'><i>THE EARLY SCOUT GETS THE BIRD</i></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>

<div class='ic013'>
<p><span class='small'><i>By H. B. Hammill, Jr.</i><br />Committeeman, Troop 64,<br />Williamsville, N.Y.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c030'>In the fall too, hikes were necessary, to check
on the houses to see how they were standing up,
and also to clean them out. Bluebirds won’t use a
house that contains the remnants of a last year’s
nest. So the houses were all cleaned to be ready
for the 1949 season.</p>
<p class='c032'><b>Community Service</b></p>
<p class='c030'>Of course there is one more “bird” that we
haven’t mentioned yet—and probably the most
important. This was one of the best community
service projects we could try. For bluebirds are
insect eating birds, and one family in one season
can destroy an unbelievable number of harmful
insects. Attracting the birds to orchard country
should certainly help to improve the apple crop—at
the same time the birds are among the first to
arrive in spring and they stay all summer. They
are colorful, cheerful birds and their very presence
should help to make some people happier—just
to see and listen to them.</p>

<p class='c030'>So that’s our birdhouse story. It was a project
that lasted for six months. It is good Scouting all
the way through, and it was not hard to organize.
We heartily recommend it to others. But remember!
The early Scouts get the bird! Start it now, so
the houses are up by the end of February. Bluebirds
come early and prefer “weathered” houses.
You too, can “kill” six birds with one stone.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='c007'>●</span> Spotlight the adventure of Senior Scouting
during Scout Week, February 6-12. Scouting
will be in the national news—newspapers, magazines,
newsreels, and radio. People will be especially
aware of Scouting. You can localize this
priceless publicity by newsworthy activities in
your Senior Unit.</p>

<p class='c030'>Select projects from the outline below, based on
the theme “Adventure—That’s Scouting!” Then
put the spotlight on your Unit by giving the facts
to the local newspaper and radio editors.</p>

<p class='c030'>In Senior Scouting there is Adventure in Fun
and Fellowship. A spotlight activity may be:</p>

    <div><span class='xlarge'><i>Honor Day!</i></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c030'>Honor an outstanding student, athlete, musician,
teacher, hero, or others deserving special tribute.
This may be arranged as a school assembly or
chapel program or a special banquet given by the
Unit.</p>

<p class='c030'>In addition to a well prepared sincere tribute,
your Unit may give the honored guest a lasting
token in the form of a certificate or plaque prepared
by members of the Unit.</p>

<p class='c030'>More than one person may be honored if care is
taken not to cheapen the recognition by giving it
indiscriminately or by allowing any possible criticism
of the Unit making an award for political
reasons or to secure privilege.</p>

<p class='c030'>The type of achievement recognized may vary
from year to year to insure honor for someone
who greatly deserves it but may otherwise be overlooked.
This may include honoring the outstanding
youth leader of the community, a minister, an all-round
Scout, or all-round girl student.</p>

<p class='c030'>This acid test must be applied to every recipient
if a Senior Scout Unit is to be justified in giving
recognition:</p>

<p class='c030'>1. Is the person a good citizen, recognizing his
responsibility in a democracy?</p>

<p class='c030'>2. Does the person to the best of his ability exemplify
the virtues expressed in the Scout Oath
and Law in his daily life?</p>

<p class='c030'>Run it on an inter-Crew or inter-Unit basis. Let
each group invite a guest (prospective member) to
take part. Provide coaching for everyone before
each competition or demonstration. Give each man
a score card so he may keep a record of his proficiency
in sports. Crews or Units may alternate
as coaches and judges for the various events. The
following list suggests enough to make up either
a long or a short program:</p>
<p class='c032'><i>Emergency Service training.</i></p>
<p class='c030'>Mile run—run a mile in 7½ minutes or less.
Score 10 for 7½ minutes; add 2 for each half-minute
less; deduct 2 for each half-minute more.</p>

<p class='c030'>Rope work—secure boat to piling (clove hitch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>or two half hitches), lower man from wall (bowline
on bight), secure line to corner of sail or tent
where grommet has pulled out (sheet bend), secure
rope to tent stake (taut line hitch), throw rope
with knot for rescue (bowline). Score 2 for each
correct knot.</p>
<p class='c032'><i>Rowing demonstration.</i></p>
<p class='c030'>Row 50 feet to buoy, turn, and return. Show
proper entry, feathering, and stroke of oars; turning
boat; holding it on course. Score 10 for perfect
demonstration; deduct 1 for each mistake.</p>
<p class='c032'><i>Archery contest.</i></p>
<p class='c030'>Place shooting line at 15 yards from 48-inch
target. Allow 3 arrows for sighting in, and 6 for
scoring. Score according to standard archery target
points; divide total by 5.</p>
<p class='c032'><i>Skish (bait casting) contest.</i></p>
<p class='c030'>If floating skish rings are not available, lay out
4 concentric rope rings on ground, 3, 5, 7, and 9
feet in diameter. Place center of target 15 yards
from casting line. Allow 5 casts for instruction, and
5 for scoring. Score 20 for cast in or on skish ring
or center rope ring, 15 for cast within 2 feet or less
(in second ring), 10 for within 4 feet (in third
ring), and 5 for within 6 feet (in third ring);
divide total by 10.</p>
<p class='c032'><i>Rifle shooting.</i></p>
<p class='c030'>In prone position shoot 3 rounds for sighting in,
and 5 rounds for scoring. Score according to standard
target points; divide total by 5.</p>

<p class='c030'>In the next three events the basic timing of 20,
5, and 3 minutes may not be appropriate for your
group. Try each event a few times and determine
the average time to use as a base.</p>
<p class='c032'><i>Compass racing.</i></p>
<p class='c030'>Lay out a course that will take about 20 minutes
on the average (see <span class='sc'>Scouting</span> Magazine, September,
1948). Score 10 for 20 minutes; add 1 for each
half-minute less; deduct 1 for each half-minute
more.</p>
<p class='c032'><i>Canoe carrying.</i></p>
<p class='c030'>Lift a canoe from the ground (with aid of tree
or rack to lean it on), make portage carry 25 yards
and return, and lower canoe to ground. Score 10
for 5 minutes; add 2 for each half-minute less;
deduct 2 for each half-minute more. Disqualify for
rough handling of canoe.</p>
<p class='c032'><i>Axemanship.</i></p>
<p class='c030'>Chop 10-12-inch log in two, using long-handled
axe and taking all safety precautions. Score 10 for
3 minutes; add 2 for each half-minute less; deduct
2 for each half-minute more.</p>
<p class='c032'><i>Bucksawmanship.</i></p>
<p class='c030'>Place 6-inch log on sawbuck. With bucksaw cut
off as many sections (about 2 inches thick) as possible
in 5 minutes. Score 1 for each section cut.</p>

<p class='c030'>The following are demonstrations for which you
can work out your own scoring system.</p>
<p class='c032'><i>Rope rescue.</i></p>
<p class='c030'>Rescue a man marooned across a ravine or stream
20 feet wide. Use ropes, vines, temporary bridge,
or raft (see <span class='sc'>Scouting</span> Magazine, March, 1947).</p>
<p class='c032'><i>Wild foods.</i></p>
<p class='c030'>Find as many wild foods as possible, and prepare
enough for tasting by the whole group.</p>
<p class='c032'><i>Overnight camp.</i></p>
<p class='c030'>Set up a Crew camp with proper shelter, beds,
sanitation, water supply, and fires.</p>
<p class='c032'><i>Breeches buoy rescue.</i></p>
<p class='c030'>Rescue a man from a mast 40-50 feet away (see
<i>Sea Scout Manual</i> Chapter 18).</p>

will plan menus, purchase food (no, he won’t have

entertainment, include cost, and finally report to
the family showing a saving if possible on a satisfactory
program.</p>

<p class='c030'>Preliminary conferences with mother and dad

<p class='c029'><span class='c007'>●</span> <span class='xlarge'><i>It’s On Ice</i></span></p>
<p class='c029'>If your Unit is in the two-thirds of the States
in the snow belt, it can do something spectacular
when called on this winter for an act in a Council
circus, high school assembly, or Scout Week demonstration.
That is an ice rescue staged in realistic
fashion.</p>

<p class='c030'>A skater gliding around a pond suddenly breaks
through. As he thrashes around in the water, another
skater comes along, tries a rescue by incorrect
methods, gets too close, and also breaks
through. Then two Senior Scouts—instead of the
Lone Ranger—come along and rescue the skater-swimmers.</p>

<p class='c030'>The action takes from five to ten minutes, depending
on how much of a script is written for it.
A commentator verbally sets the scene and explains
the wrong and right rescue techniques as
they are used. If a public address system is not
available, a megaphone or a strong voice should
be sufficient.</p>

<p class='c030'>The spectacular part is the staging. It is best in
an arena where the spectators look down on it,
although a stage will do, the lower the better. A
platform is set up and covered with newsprint.
The platform can be put together from fifteen long
tables such as found in many church dining rooms.
Set them together, three long and five wide, with
an opening in the center of the resulting oblong.
In this opening set a tank of water. It may be hard
to get and handle, but it is the crowning touch
when the audience sees the victims splashing about
in real water.</p>

<p class='c030'>Cover the whole platform, including the hole,
with three or four thicknesses of blank newsprint.
Ask the press foreman at a newspaper plant for
the paper left on the spindles at the end of the roll.</p>

<p class='c030'>The four actors, wearing ice skates, can give a
good imitation of skating on ice after a little practice.
Rehearse the act—dry runs without the
water and paper—until it clicks. The actors and
commentator will have to coordinate themselves.
The men at the mike may have to work up a few
ad libs where action might slow down in a performance.
Then have a dress rehearsal.</p>

<p class='c030'>Ice rescue techniques may be found in the <i>Safety</i>
Merit Badge pamphlet and the <i>Scout Field Book</i>.</p>
<p class='c032'><span class='xlarge'><i>Game Equipment</i></span></p>
<p class='c030'>Game, equipment in your headquarters comes in
handy during parties, and also is a pre-meeting
attraction. The one danger is that sometimes the
games are so popular they stretch the pre-meeting
period over the major part of the evening. However,
that can be avoided by a gentlemen’s agreement
to close the games at a definite time on meeting
nights.</p>

<p class='c030'>Game equipment can be bought, of course, but
it can be made inexpensively.</p>

<p class='c030'>Darts is a game the GI’s found popular in war-time
England. Make the target of corrugated cardboard
cut from a large carton. Mark colored concentric
circles on it with crayons. Make each dart
of a match stick (kitchen size). On one end lash a
needle with thread. On the other glue four small
paper fins. Hang the target on the wall and let fly
with the darts, making sure the firing range is not
a thoroughfare.</p>

<p class='c030'><i>Table tennis</i> requires a smooth 5´ × 9´ playing
surface. If you don’t have a suitable table, get a
piece of half-inch plywood. Sometimes you can
make a better deal by taking two large scraps of
standard pieces, sawing them to 5´ × 4½´ and then
hinging or cleating them together on the bottom.
If you don’t want to bother putting legs on this
playing surface, lay it on a large table or two small
ones, just so it is at least 30 inches off the floor.</p>

<p class='c030'>Make paddles of quarter or eighth-inch wood,
whittled or cut with a coping saw to shape and
then sandpapered. They may be any size, but generally
are 6″ × 12″ over-all.</p>

<p class='c030'>The net must be 6″ above the table. Make it of
cheese cloth or muslin, hemmed and reinforced
with strong cord threaded through the hems. Hang
it from dowels set in cleats that extend beyond the
table edge at the center line.</p>

<p class='c030'>Buy a supply of balls at the dime or sports store,
or mail order house, and soon you’ll be searching
for them under the furniture.</p>

<p class='c030'><i>Other games</i> for which you can make most of
your own equipment are shuffleboard and paddle
tennis, providing you have floor space of 52´ × 6´
for the first, and 20´ × 44´ for the second. Buy or
borrow a rule book, find dimensions of equipment,
and turn it out in your workshop.</p>

<p><i><b>By Ralph H. Moza</b></i> <span class='small'>Assistant National Director, Senior Scouting Service</span></p>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c029'><span class='c007'>●</span> Before the swirling flood waters had stopped
pouring into Vanport, Oregon, last May, Sea
Scouts were driving rescue boats through the break
in the levee. They had been alerted two days
earlier, and were ready when called.</p>

<p class='c030'>Will your Senior Unit be ready when needed for
disaster duty?</p>

<p class='c030'>You cannot answer that question easily, because
flood, fire, explosion, tornado, and earthquake strike
so suddenly that there rarely is time for alerting.
You may even think you will never have to face
an emergency. But remember, few of the people
at any scene of disaster <i>expected</i> it to happen to
themselves!</p>

<p class='c030'>One thing is certain: if an emergency does occur
in your community, Senior Scouts who have had
emergency service training will be very greatly
appreciated men to have on hand.</p>

<p class='c030'>Every registered Senior Scout Unit is a potential
Emergency Service Corps. As a Senior Scout registers
in his Unit and becomes an Apprentice Senior
Scout, he can at the same time become an Emergency
Service Apprentice.</p>

<p class='c030'>The Emergency Service
Corps consists of Senior Scouts
in their existing Units, under
their own leadership, or Crews
of Emergency Service Corps
members in registered Boy
Scout Troops, under their own
Unit leadership. The term
“Crew” replaces “Patrol” in
Troops, thus indicating that it
is a young man’s group.</p>

<p class='c030'>There are three good reasons
for promoting Emergency Service
Training in Senior Units:</p>

<p class='c030'>1. Senior Scouts are often the first to be called
for service when disaster strikes. With this in
mind, Emergency Service Training stimulates interest
in the service principle of Scouting, as out-lined
in the Oath, Law, and Motto.</p>

<p class='c030'>2. As one of the important parts in the vigorous
physical activity program requiring knowledge and
skill, Emergency Service Training can be one of
the important activities planned and promoted by
the outdoor committee.</p>

<p class='c030'>3. It develops knowledge and skills which contribute
to the worthwhile training of the Scout,
and insures his effectiveness in time of Emergency.</p>
<p class='c032'><span class='large'><b>THE NEW PLAN</b></span></p>
<p class='c030'>One of the most important changes in the Emergency
Service Training Plan is that the emphasis
is now on training being carried out within the
Unit, under Unit leadership. It is recommended
that the Local Council have a member of the District
Commissioner’s Staff specialize as a coordinator
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>of all Emergency Service Corps Units within
his District. His responsibility would be to coordinate
and supervise the activity of Emergency Service
Corps within his area, organized in Senior
Scout Units and Emergency Service Crews (within
Scout Troops). He would stimulate Emergency
Service Training within the Unit, providing lists
of qualified instructors in the various skills required
for Corps membership. He would recommend
joint planning of inter-Unit and District
activities for the purpose of Emergency Service
Training, practice, and demonstration when and as
desirable.</p>

<p class='c030'>If an area larger than a geographical District is
stricken, a Scout Executive, a Field Executive, or a
Special Field Commissioner, should serve as Special
Director and coordinator of the various Emergency
Service Corps involved.</p>
<p class='c032'><span class='large'><b>START NOW!</b></span></p>
<p class='c030'>Now is the time to start pointing out the various
phases of Emergency Service Training to program
planning committees, and indicating how it affects
them. Get them to suggest plans for organizing a
Corps within their Unit.</p>

<p class='c030'>The Senior Scout is immediately qualified as an
Apprentice Emergency Service Corps member if
the information obtained in any recent medical
examination is sufficient to cover the items listed
on the application for membership (Form C-1278,
Cat. No. 4425), by adding the health history, and
filing the application with parents’ approval.</p>

<p class='c030'>The next step is to develop activity programs
which will enable him to qualify for full membership.
The requirements for the Emergency Service
Corps are as follows:</p>

<p class='c030'>Be a Registered Air Scout Observer, Explorer
Woodsman, Ordinary Sea Scout, or First Class
Scout of 15 or over, in excellent physical condition
as shown by medical examination. He must run one
mile in 7½ minutes, and climb an 18-foot rope,
hand over hand in 25 seconds or less. He must whip
the ends of a rope of at least ½-inch in diameter,
and tie a square knot, sheet bend, bowline, bowline-on-a-bight,
two half hitches, clove hitch, clove
hitch secured with half hitch, taut line hitch, and
Timber hitch.</p>

<p class='c030'>Finally, he must have the written permission of
his parents or guardian, the approval of his Unit
leader, and must have earned the following Merit
Badges: First Aid, Firemanship, Life Saving, Path-finding,
Personal Health, Public Health, Rowing
(where necessary), and Safety.</p>

</div>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i37a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c029'><span class='c007'>⚜</span> Sometimes knowing the right
thing to do in an emergency is
just as important as having the courage
to do it. That’s one reason why in
Scouting, First Aid is an essential
part of the Scout requirements. For
instance, if Second Class Scout
Gerald Maley of Cleveland, Ohio,
had not practiced his First Aid, his
friend would not be alive today.
Last November, Scout Maley with
his friend Norman were crossing a
railroad bridge when the wind blew
Maley’s hat off. It landed somewhere
in the railroad yard under
the bridge and the two boys climbed
down to the yard to recover it.
They hunted, but could not find it.
Suddenly, Norman had an idea.
“I’ll bet it’s on top of that box car
over there.”</p>

<p class='c030'>Up he climbed to look for it. Half
way up he slipped, tried to save
himself and grabbed a live wire
which was hanging low.</p>

<p class='c030'>The shock knocked him to the
ground and the Scout ran to help
him. Norman lay without moving
and the Scout thought at first he
was dead. But he had been practicing
his First Aid in his Patrol. He
immediately started artificial respiration
in earnest just as he had
practiced it in meeting the week
before.</p>

<p class='c030'>Soon Norman was breathing
again, but screamed in agony as he
came back to consciousness. He was
terribly burned about the hands
and arms. Again the Scout went
into action. “Hang on, I’ll get you
up to the road, we’ll find somebody
who can get you to a doctor.”</p>

<p class='c030'>“Transporting Injured,” he said
to himself, “no chance for a four
man carry now, I’ll have to use the
good old ‘pack-strap’.”</p>

<p class='c030'>He got Norman’s arms over his
shoulders from his back and somehow
managed to get up the bank to
the bridge. Here he had to rest, but
fortunately a car passed soon. Scout
Maley hailed it and Norman was on
his way to the hospital for treatment.
After a few days he recovered.</p>

<p class='c030'>The really remarkable part of
this story is that Scout Maley was
a smaller boy than his friend, and
has a crippled leg, so that he is
obliged to walk with a decided
limp.</p>

<p class='c030'>Some of you fellows with two
eyes and strong arms and whole
limbs might think over what this
Boy Scout accomplished, as a result
of his Scout training, to save
his friend.</p>

<p class='c030'>In recognition of Scout Gerald
Maley’s skill, the National Board
of Honor awarded him the prized
medal of Merit, which is given in
recognition of an outstanding act
of service, putting into practice
Scout skills and ideals.</p>

</div>
<p class='c029'>“<span class='sc'>I have</span> a problem, and I’m <i>glad</i>!”
said someone. We looked up
to see—you guessed it, our old
friend Scoutmaster BLIMP. His
Troop is just as lively as ever,
maybe more so. It’s a good Troop.</p>

<p class='c030'>“Who in the world,” we asked,
“ever heard of anyone being glad
he had a problem?”</p>

<p class='c030'>“Oh, but you don’t understand,”
BLIMP went on, “my problem is
the kind you can be glad about.
Want to hear the details?”</p>

<p class='c030'>“Is it optional?” we asked, knowing
better.</p>

<p class='c030'>“No,” replied BLIMP. “It’s very
simple. Before I got wise to myself,
I used to worry a lot about what
in the world to DO at Troop meetings.
Since I have started using
the <i>Program Notebook</i> and all the
swell ideas in <span class='sc'>Scouting</span> (see contents,
Page 1) and since my Scouts
have been reading <span class='sc'>Boys’ Life</span>, we
have a new and interesting problem
... with all this material we
worry about <i>what to leave out</i>!”</p>

<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c030'>Troops which discovered this new
problem have just about finished
a whirlwind month of compass
work and orienteering, with a
world of usable games and teaching
methods in <span class='sc'>Scouting</span> and almost
an entire issue of <span class='sc'>Boys’ Life</span>
showing the Scouts the “how” of
it.</p>

<p class='c030'>There’s no excuse for running
out of ideas!</p>

<p class='c030'>The same is true of January. The
December issue of <span class='sc'>Boys’ Life</span>
(which will soon be on its way to
your boys) is crammed full of
ideas on “Handicraft,” the very
popular theme for January.</p>

<p class='c030'>Your Scouts will feast their eyes
on a swell photo-feature called
“Bead Work,” a Ben Hunt special
which will bring out the Indian in
a lot of our boys, and that’s good!
This ONE feature <i>will be reprinted</i>,
if you need a few just drop us a
card.</p>

<p class='c030'>Other handicrafts include “Tie
Pins” by Glenn Wagner (no, <i>not</i>
Pie Tins!) and a bunch of back-of-the-book
nifties you’ll want to try.
Of course, Green Bar Bill scores
his usual bull’s-eye with a page of
terrific ideas for P.L.s, and all the
usual features, articles, and shorts.</p>

<p class='c030'>We toss-up an action packed basketball
serial, “Backboard Magic”
by Howard M. Brier, as well as
“Rambling Christmas Tree” and
“Voice of the Ugly Truck” by Ward
and Conley respectively. There is a
thrilling mountain climb described
in “Ladders to the Clouds,” by
Joseph Stocker, “Geared for Winter
Woods,” by John J. Rowlands,
and page after page of other thrilling
Scout material.</p>

<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c030'>“May I put on my false whiskers
and make a good suggestion,”
asked BLIMP who has been peering
over our shoulder.</p>

<p class='c030'>“I know ... I know ...” we
interrupted. “Remind all Scouters
that there is NO better Christmas
present for any boy, or any Troop
... than <span class='sc'>Boys’ Life</span>.”</p>

<p class='c030'>“Exactly!” he replied, as he
banged the door and went cheerily
down the hall whistling “Jingle
Bells!”</p>

<p class='c030'>It is dangerous to neglect wounds, however small;
even scratches and small cuts may cause serious infections
if they are not properly treated.</p>

<p class='c030'>Mercurochrome (H.W.&amp;D. brand of merbromin,
dibromoxymercurifluorescein-sodium) is one
of the best antiseptics for first aid use. It is accepted
by the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the
American Medical Association for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c030'>The 2% aqueous solution in applicator bottles
does not sting and can be applied safely to small
wounds. Injuries are reported promptly when Mercurochrome
is used, because the treatment does not
hurt. Other advantages are that the solution keeps
indefinitely and the color shows just where it has
been applied.</p>

<p class='c030'>Doctors have used Mercurochrome in their practice
for more than 25 years.</p>

<p class='c030'>Keep a bottle of Mercurochrome handy for the
first aid care of all minor wounds. Do not fail to call
a physician in more serious cases.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
